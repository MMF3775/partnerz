Because this can prevent customers from starting a conversation, Workflows with a conversation-based trigger (e.g. \u201cCustomer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\u201d, \u201cCustomer sends their first message\u201d, \u201cCustomer sends any message\u201d) will never fire for these customers.\nDisabled Messenger\nShow the Messenger Launcher\nis a Messenger setting which can be configured to hide the Messenger from customers. If the Messenger is hidden from customers, any Workflow which involves an interaction with the Messenger (e.g. \u201cWhen a customer visits your site\u201d, \u201cWhen a customer clicks on a website element\u201d, \u201cWhen a customer opens the Messenger\u201d) will never fire for these customers.\nAutomation Basics\nIf you have\nconversation ratings\nturned on in your\nSimple automations settings\nfor Leads and Users, this can get in the way of the\ninactivity triggers\nworking as they should. It can unintentionally get interrupted in a way that blocks other customer-facing Workflows from triggering.\nOur team is still exploring a fix for this, but we do have a workaround in the meantime if you see these issues often.\nInstead of sending the conversation rating via the basics settings, you should\ncreate a Workflow to send these ratings instead\n. This will prevent the issue going forward.\n\u200b\nWorkflow Trigger Settings\nWhich trigger you choose for your workflow and how you configure the trigger settings will decide who/what can match the workflow and whether it triggers.\nIf your workflow isn't triggering for specific actions, check for mismatches in your target criteria. For example, if a workflow doesn't trigger for a specific email, verify that the email conditions in your trigger settings are correct. For routing inbound emails effectively, use the \"Customer Sends First Message\" trigger and filter by email attributes rather than using email filters. Also remember that outbound workflows such as \"Customer visits a page\" are designed for specific triggers and are typically not tied to conversation initiation.\nExample:\nYou set up workflow with the trigger \"When customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\" and add a step to tag all of these conversations.\nA customer replies to a post you sent from Outbound.\nThis conversation\nwould not\nbe tagged because they didn't start the conversation in the Messenger (they replied to an outbound message).\nIf you want\nall\nconversations to be tagged, you should use the trigger \"When customer sends any message\" instead.\nTargeting leads vs. users in workflows\nIf a workflow (for example, an after-hours response) fails to trigger because it targets \"Users\" but the conversation is with a \"Lead,\" your automation won't run as expected. Always check if your workflow should include both Users and Leads in its trigger settings.\nType of workflow\nYou can only have one customer-facing workflow running in a conversation at a time. Actions that would interrupt a customer-facing workflow and allow another customer-facing workflow to be triggered are teammate actions and include:\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOpen\nOpen and re-assign\nSending a comment\nAfter a customer-facing workflow has been interrupted, another customer-facing workflow is free to jump in.\nAudience targeting\nAudience targeting rules\ncan influence who will be affected by a Workflow. If the customer does not match the specified audience criteria, the Workflow will not fire.\nUsing And/Or rules\nWhen using\n\"OR\" rules\nin audience targeting, only\none condition needs to be true\nfor the rule to apply. This means that if any of the individual conditions match, the workflow will trigger, even if other conditions do not.\nExample:\nLet's say you set up an audience rule based on the\nCity\nattribute with the following logic:\n\"City is not Dublin\"\nOR \"\nCity is not London\".\nIf a user is in\nLondon\n, the rule will evaluate as follows:\nFirst, it checks:\nCity is not Dublin\n\u2192 Since the user is in London, this condition is\ntrue\n.\nBecause an\n\"OR\"\nrule only requires one condition to be true, the workflow\ndoes not check the second condition\n(whether the city is not London). The rule is already satisfied, and the workflow proceeds.\nThis means users in either Dublin or London may still receive the message or trigger the workflow unexpectedly.\nSo if you want to exclude users in both Dublin and London, you need to switch from\n\"OR\"\nlogic to\n\"AND\"\nlogic:\n\"City is not Dublin\"\nAND \"\nCity is not London\".\nWith this setup:\nThe user must not be in Dublin\nand\nmust not be in London for the workflow to trigger.\nIf they are in either city, the audience rule does not match, and the workflow does not trigger.\nKey takeaways\nOR rules\ntrigger if\nany\ncondition is met.\nNegative OR rules\ncan lead to unintended matches because once one condition is true, others are ignored.\nUse AND rules\nwhen you need all conditions to be met before triggering the workflow.\nPerson Data & Company Data\nYour Workflow may have specific triggers based on personal or company data \u2014 these can be any of the standard or\ncustom data attributes\navailable in Intercom. You should check the criteria and conditions set for these triggers, and ensure that the data is correctly inputted and matches the set rules.\nExample:\nWhen using branches in a workflow, if checking for:\n\"Company attribute is not\".\n\u200b\nThe customer must be attached to a company to meet the condition rule and match. If we don't have a company to check the attribute, we won't assume that the condition is true - instead we will fallback to another path.\nFrequency & Scheduling\nUsing frequency and scheduling\n, you can control when, and for how long, a Workflow is live. It can often be the case that a Workflow is not firing because the criteria for when the Workflow is scheduled is not met.\nCustom date schedule\nThe Workflow may have a\ncustom date schedule\n\u2014 for example, to only fire between Friday evening and Saturday morning. In this case, testing the Workflow outside of these hours will not trigger the Workflow \u2014 no matter which\ntrigger\nis selected.\nOffice hours\nYou may have configured\nOffice Hours\nfor your Workflow to fire within \u2014 either\nDuring office hours\nor\nOutside office hours.\nWorkflows only use the default office hours, not the custom office hours set for individual teams.\nWe recommend moving office hours rules inside your Workflows as\nconditional branches\n, rather than in the trigger settings for a Workflow.\nTrigger settings are evaluated when your customer interacts with the Messenger, whereas branches are evaluated in real time during a conversation so are much better at handling time-based conditions.\nChannels\nIf your Workflow is configured to\nspecific channels\nlike Email, SMS, or social media, make sure that the channel is correctly connected and active. A disconnected channel might be the reason why a Workflow is not firing. Additionally, ensure your workflow's channel settings align with how users are interacting - if a workflow is set to only trigger via \"email\" and the user interacts via the Messenger, the workflow will not trigger.\nNote:\nIf a customer creates multiple email conversations within a 2-minute window, Intercom will disregard matching to the subsequent conversations. The customer will still be able to create the additional conversations, but Intercom will not elect any workflows to run in those conversations.\nPreventing repeated workflow triggers\nWhen configuring workflows that respond to customer messages, you may want to prevent the same workflow from triggering multiple times within a conversation, especially when users follow up with additional details.\nSolution: Use conversation tags to control workflow triggers\nAdd a specific tag (e.g., \"Pricing\") to conversations when your workflow runs.\nConfigure workflows to check for the absence of this tag before triggering.\nThis approach ensures each workflow triggers only once per conversation, preventing duplicate automated responses.\nThis tagging system is particularly useful for workflows triggered by conditions like \"Customer sends their first message\" or \"Customer sends any message\" where follow-up messages could potentially re-trigger your automation.\nBest Practices for Workflow Configuration\nHere are some best practices to ensure your Workflows operate smoothly:\nAlways run tests\nafter modifying Workflow configurations, ensuring triggers behave as expected.\nUse descriptive and consistent naming conventions\nfor Workflows and rules to simplify troubleshooting.\nPage URL Settings\nEnsure that the Workflow is correctly configured to fire on the right\nPage URLs\nor within the correct applications on iOS & Android devices. Misconfiguration in these settings may prevent the Workflow from triggering.\nURL targeting best practices\nThe\nCurrent page URL\ntargeting can be added in the \"Where to send\" section or the main Audience targeting section within the\nTrigger rule\nsettings. However, their functionality differs based on the section they are placed in:\nAudience Targeting\n:\nURL configurations here target users based on the\nlast page they visited\n. This data might not always be current, which may lead to inaccurate Workflows firing.\nWhere to send\n:\nOffers a more reliable targeting based on the actual page the user is currently on. This usually matches the desired outcome.\nUsing URL targeting in the\nWhere to send\nsection will disable the inbound bot on iOS & Android, as mobile apps don't recognize URLs. If URL targeting is crucial, create one bot specifically for web Messenger and another for iOS & Android without URL rules.\nWhy 'Current page URL' doesn't work for Facebook/Instagram conversations\nThe \"Current page URL\" filter only applies to pages where the\nIntercom Messenger is installed\n. This means it does not capture URLs for conversations that originate from external platforms like Facebook because those interactions happen outside your website.\nUse 'Page URL' instead\nTo properly filter conversations from different channels (e.g. Facebook and Instagram), you should use the \"Page URL\" filter instead. This filter can track the referring page or external sources, allowing you to correctly segment and trigger workflows based on where the conversation started.\nFin Automation Issues\nFin AI Agent can sometimes interact with Workflows in ways that lead to unexpected behavior. Here's how to address common Fin-related Workflow issues:\nEnabling CSAT for Fin Workflow Closures\nCSAT Workflows do not automatically trigger when Fin closes a conversation. To ensure CSAT surveys are sent, set them up within the Workflow using the \"\nLet Fin answer\n\" step. For more detailed instructions, refer to\nFin CSAT documentation\n.\nUsers Being Asked Repetitive Questions\nWorkflows configured to \"\nGet context about issue upfront\n\" may cause users to be repeatedly prompted for the same information (e.g., name, email). To fix this, turn off this setting under\nFin AI Agent\n>\nSimple Automation\n>\nGet context about issue upfront\nfor both users and leads.\nFin Workflow Failing to Process Emails\nEmail-based Workflows can fail if emails are not correctly forwarded from the designated address to Intercom. Double-check the\nemail forwarding configuration\nas errors here often prevent email processing.\nBy checking these areas and confirming the proper setup, you can not only identify the potential cause for a Workflow not firing but also ensure it is configured correctly for future operations. \ud83d\udc4c\nIf you still need help debugging your Workflow, reach out to our Support team through the Messenger.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow to trigger a Workflow\nConfigure Workflow trigger settings\nBuild inbox automations using Workflows\nWorkflows FAQs\nMoving your Profiles to Workflows"},

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8826728-workflows-faqs", "title": "Workflows FAQs", "content": "Triggering Workflows\nWhy is my workflow not firing?\nA Workflow may not trigger as expected due to configuration issues, such as channel compatibility, audience rules, scheduling, or conflicts with your Messenger settings.\nSee how to troubleshoot these issues\n.\nHow can I see for which conversations my workflow fired?\nYou can check when a workflow fired in conversation from:\nSent tab in Workflows:\nCheck the Sent tab within each Workflow. It will display a list of conversations where the Workflow has fired.\nConversation Events in the Inbox:\nWithin the Inbox, you can see the lineage of events that have occurred in a conversation by clicking\nShow conversation events\n. This will show you the conversation events, and you can find out which Workflow has been fired within a conversation.\nSimulating a Conversation:\nIf you want to test out your Workflow, you can either use the\nWorkflows Preview\nfeature, or you can target the Workflow to be set live with an audience of only yourself or your teammates. To do this, simply select the\nEmail\nattribute, and enter your own email address \u2014 or \u201ccontains\u201d your company\u2019s email domain (@examply.com).\nCan I use reusable workflows in conversations to collect customer data?\nYes, you can create reusable workflows that collect customer data, such as email, phone, name, as well as custom attributes you track in Intercom.\nHow do I trigger a workflow based on user attribute change?\nThis is currently not possible with Workflows, but you can\nsubmit this as a feature request\nif you'd find it helpful!\nHow can I prevent the welcome bot from showing the full message and options when a user visits the page?\nTo prevent the welcome bot from showing the full message and options when a user visits the page, you need to use a different workflow trigger. Instead of using the \"customer visits a page\" trigger, which causes the Workflow to proactively pop up, use the \"Customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\" trigger. This way, the welcome message in your workflow will only appear when a user starts a conversation through the Messenger.\nHow can I prevent users from bypassing outbound message workflows in the Messenger?\nCustomers can sometimes bypass outbound message workflows by clicking directly on the Messenger launcher and starting a conversation outside the intended flow.\nThere are two main ways to address this:\nDisable Direct Messages\nYou can turn off the \u201cLet users start a conversation\u201d Messenger setting. This prevents users from initiating conversations outside your workflows. However, this may reduce flexibility and could lead to a less intuitive experience for customers.\nUse a \u201cWhen customer sends their first message\u201d Workflow\nA more user-friendly approach is to create a workflow that uses the \"When customer sends their first message\" trigger. This allows you to guide the conversation flow properly while preserving a better customer experience.\nBuilding Workflows\nHow do I get access to outbound bots in Intercom?\nTo access outbound bots (Workflows) in Intercom, make sure the following requirements are met:\nPlan access:\nYou must be on the Advanced plan or higher to use workflows.\nWorkspace permissions:\nYou need the \u201cCan manage outbound workflows\u201d permission enabled. This can be found under the \u201cAutomation\u201d section in teammate permissions. Your workspace admin can grant you this permission.\nNote:\nAdditional workflow features are available on the\nExpert plan\n.\nYou can review the full feature breakdown for each plan on\nIntercom\u2019s pricing page\n.\nCan I tag conversations in bulk when sending a workflow, even if the customer doesn\u2019t respond?\nYes, you can automatically tag conversations by adding a 'Tag conversation' step in your workflow. Click\nAdd step\nanywhere in your workflow path and select\nTag conversation\n. This applies only to conversations moving forward and does not work retroactively.\nHow can I create and prioritize \"if\" conditions in workflows?\nTo create and prioritize \"if\" conditions in workflows, you can add more conditional\nbranches\n. Priority goes by top to bottom when using branches.\nCan I use any tag as the audience rule to trigger the workflow?\nAt the moment, you can select only\nPeople\nor\nCompany\ntag when setting up the audience filter for the workflow. Conversation tag can't be used for this purpose.\nHow can I let the user open an external website from a workflow?\nTo add external content to a workflow, you can add the step \"Send an app\" and select the Content Showcase app.\nDoes a workflow with \"Message contains\" also look for keywords in email subject lines?\nYes, when you add a condition \"Message contains XYZ\" to a workflow, it will also look in the subject of the email, not just the body. Even when using a separate condition for \"Email subject contains XYX\", if you use \"Message contains\" this will include the email subject as well.\nWill I be charged for sending messages through Workflows?\nThis depends on the channels you've enabled for the workflow. There is no charge for sending workflow messages on Web, iOS, Android, Facebook, Instagram, and Email.\nHowever, if you've selected SMS or WhatsApp as one of the workflow channels, any messages sent on these channels would be charged at their\nrespective rates\n.\nHow can I automatically set a ticket to \"In progress\" when a customer replies to a Resolved/Closed ticket?\nTo achieve this, you'll need to create two workflows:\nReusable workflow:\nThis workflow sets the ticket status to \"In Progress.\"\nWhen customer sends any message workflow\n: Add a branch to check if the ticket status is \"Resolved\", then pass it to the reusable workflow to update the status to \"In progress\".\nThis setup ensures that any customer reply to a Resolved/Closed ticket will automatically move it to \"In progress.\"\nHow can I automatically assign a teammate when reassigning a conversation to a team inbox?\nYou can set up a workflow with the \"If teammate changes the conversation assignment\" trigger to automatically assign a specific teammate when a conversation is assigned to a team inbox.\nSelect the \"Team assigned is [X]\" in the trigger audience:\nThen add a workflow path using the\nAssign\nstep to assign to a teammate:\nNote:\nIf you want to distribute conversations evenly among multiple teammates (e.g., using round-robin or balanced assignment), this method won\u2019t work. This workflow only allows you to automatically reassign a conversation to a specific teammate.\nHow do workflow goals count events in relation to workflow triggers, and what\u2019s the difference between \u201chit the goal\u201d and \u201chit the goal after engaging\u201d?\nWorkflow goals only count events that happen\nafter\nthe workflow is triggered\u2014they don\u2019t include any events that occurred before it was sent.\nHit the goal:\nmeans the user completed the goal event after the workflow was sent, regardless of whether they interacted with the workflow.\nHit the goal after engaging:\nmeans the user completed the goal event\nafter\nactively engaging with the workflow (e.g., clicking a reply button or responding to a message).\nCan I customize the appearance or placement of Workflow Reply buttons in Messenger conversations ?\nNo, the display of Quick Reply buttons within workflows cannot be customized.\nTroubleshooting\nWhat should I do if my workflow doesn't work for certain conversations?\nIf your Workflow doesn't work for certain conversations, make sure your workflow audience settings are set to trigger for the correct participant types (Leads, Visitors, and Users). Update the audience setting accordingly to resolve the issue.\nAfter my live workflow has triggered, why are the next steps not appearing or slow to appear on the customer's side within Messenger conversations?\nThis can occur due to the Content Security Policy (CSP) on your site is blocking certain connections with Intercom that are needed for Messenger to function as expected and may need to be reviewed and updated. More details on using Intercom with CSP can be found in this\narticle\n.\nHow can I automatically send a \"We are checking, please wait\" message after a customer sends their first message?\nYou can only have one customer-facing Workflow trigger per conversation. So to achieve this, edit your existing workflow for \"When customer sends their first message\" and add a step to collect the customer's first message, then add another step which sends your follow-up message:\n\"We are checking, please wait.\"\nWhy can't I use a Date & Time attribute I created in a workflow?\nDate & Time attributes cannot be used in workflows because there is no way to reliably validate the customer's timezone, which could lead to discrepancies\u2014especially if they are using a VPN or in a different location to your office hours. To avoid potential mismatches with workspace office hours, Date & Time attributes are not available to use in workflows.\nWhy isn\u2019t my workflow triggering for outbound messages when using the \"Conversation starter is Outbound message\"?\nThe \"Conversation starter is Outbound message\" audience rule for a workflow applies only when sending messages via the Outbound section in your workspace. If you're creating a conversation in the Inbox, use \"Teammate sending a direct message\" for individual messages or \"Teammate sending to many customers\" for bulk messages in your workflow audience rules.\nWhy is my workflow not working for emails converted to tickets?\nIf your workflow isn't being triggered for emails that are converted to tickets, check that \"Email\" has been selected as the channel in the workflow trigger settings (since this is the original channel the conversation started on).\nI've made updates to my workflow, but I'm not seeing these changes in the live workflow\nIf your workflow isn\u2019t displaying as expected, it\u2019s possible that your session cookie is linked to an older version. To check if this is the case, try opening the workflow in an incognito or private browsing window. This will ensure you\u2019re viewing the most up-to-date version without any cached data. If the issue persists, consider clearing your browser cookies and refreshing the page.\nWhy does my workflow stop unexpectedly after a customer clicks a specific button?\nIf your workflow stops running after a customer clicks a specific button, this typically happens because the workflow includes a step configured to \"Collect customer reply.\" The workflow halts until the customer provides an input as per this step. To ensure the workflow continues uninterrupted, review your workflow configuration and consider removing the \"Collect customer reply\" step where appropriate.\nWhy are my messages not arriving in the right inbox despite having the correct tag?\nThis typically occurs because multiple workflows with assignment actions trigger simultaneously. The workflow with the highest priority will determine the final assignment, potentially overriding others. To resolve this issue:\nReview and prioritize workflows with assignment actions to avoid conflicts.\nEnsure that no other workflows are configured with conflicting actions for the same messages (i.e. two workflows triggering for the same keywords, with different assignment actions).\nHow to Prevent Multiple CSAT Survey Triggers in Intercom Workflows When Closing Conversations?\nA common issue arises when Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) surveys are sent multiple times unintentionally, particularly when a teammate repeatedly closes a conversation. This can lead to customer frustration due to an influx of repeated CSAT surveys for the same interaction. Here are the steps for a CSAT survey to only send once, even if it's closed multiple times.\nThe Fix: Ensuring CSAT is Sent Only Once Per Conversation Closure\nTo ensure a CSAT survey is sent only once in a conversation when a teammate closes it, you need to add a specific audience rule to your workflow condition:\nAdd the Audience Rule \"Conversation rating requested is false\" to your Workflow Condition.\nBy doing so, this rule ensures that a CSAT request has not already been sent to the customer for that particular conversation. This critical condition prevents multiple survey requests from being sent to the customer if the conversation is closed or updated more than once.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nTeammate changes conversation state\nHow to trigger a Workflow\nConfigure Workflow trigger settings\nTroubleshooting when a Workflow doesn't trigger\nUse Fin AI Agent in Workflows"},

These numerical ratings let us know\nhow\nwe\u2019re doing\n.\nWe\u2019ll then ask if you would you like to add a line or two to explain what you love or how you think we could do better. These comments are \u2728gold-dust \u2728\nTaking action\nOk, this is where we are so far:\n\u2714\ufe0f  We\u2019ve asked you for feedback\n\u2714\ufe0f  You\u2019ve taken time out of your day to give us feedback\n\ud83d\udd32  Now it\u2019s on us to make sure that feedback gets put to good use.\nFirstly, we analyse the numerical ratings at an account level. If your account is on a managed plan, your relationship manager knows how you and your teammates\u2019 rate your experience with Intercom. They also see any comments from you and your team, good or bad. Honest feedback is incredibly valuable in maintaining a great constructive relationship with our customers, and knowing how we can work together for you to achieve success.\nIf you\u2019re on a self-service plan, we surface those ratings and feedback (along with our managed account feedback) to the relevant Intercom teams on a monthly basis. For example, feedback regarding our Inbox product will always get to the team who design and make it. Feedback regarding our help content will get back to our Product Education team. This is how each of our teams know where they can do better to ensure we continue to improve Intercom for our customers.\nSo that\u2019s NPS in a nutshell. We really do value your feedback, and it\nall\ngoes towards making Intercom a better product for you.\nThanks for your help \ud83d\ude4c\n*It\u2019s worth noting here that we never share this information with anyone.

Go to\nMessenger settings\n.\n2. Scroll to the\nShow the Messenger Launcher\nsection and switch off the toggle. You can also exclude your Help Center domain specifically by adding display conditions and using the filter \"Current page URL does not contain [www.yourhelpcenterdomain.com]\"\n3. Click\nSave\nto apply the changes.\nIs it possible to migrate Intercom articles to another Help Center?\nYou can\u2019t migrate or copy your Intercom articles between Help Centers in different workspaces or outside of Intercom.\nHowever, if you\u2019re using\nmultiple Help Centers\nwithin the\nsame\nworkspace, you can move articles between Help Centers. You can also use our\nAPI to export article content\nif needed.\nData & customization\nHow can I change the name of my Help Center?\nTo change the name of a Help Center, go to\nSettings > Help Center > Configure & style\nand click the name at the top of the page to rename it.\nHow do I export articles or download them as a CSV?\nIt's currently not possible to export articles or article information from within your Intercom workspace (including using the data export feature in Reports).\nWhile exporting articles via the UI isn't supported, you can use our REST API to list all the articles and extract the required information. More on our REST API can be found in our\ndeveloper docs\n\ud83d\udcda\nWhere can I find my Help Center ID?\nTo find your Help Center ID, go to\nSettings > Help Center > All Help Centers\nand then click on your Help Center, it will show in the URL bar up the top after\nhelpcenter/\n.\nCan I localize my Help Center language?\nYes, you can localize the default Help Center language with just a few clicks. Once you choose your language, the user interface of your Help Center will read in the language you set. This will change the language of your:\nSearch prompt on your homepage.\nArticle count, author and last modified date.\nReactions prompt on your articles.\n\u2018We run on Intercom\u2019 logo and more.\nYou can also configure your Help Center articles to\nsupport multiple languages\n.\nHow to localize your Help Center language\nJust go to\nSettings > Help Center > Configure & style\nand open\nSupported languages\nunder the General tab. Here, you can add new languages you want to support.\nFor example, here\u2019s how your Help Center will look in French:\nIf you\u2019d like to change the language of the Messenger, you need to do this separately in your\nMessenger Settings\n.\nHow do I configure audience targeting rules for Help Center articles in Intercom?\nArticle audience targeting in Intercom allows you to control the visibility of Help Center articles based on user-specific rules.\nPrerequisites for audience targeting\nTo enable audience targeting for Help Center articles, you must:\nSet Up a Custom Domain and Cookie Forwarding:\n- Configuring a custom domain with cookie forwarding allows Intercom to differentiate between logged-in users, visitors, and leads.- Supported setups include both subdomains (e.g.,\nhelp.exampleapp.io\n) and subpaths (e.g.,\nexampleapp.io/help\n). For details, see the\nCustom Domains Guide\n.\nEnable Audience Features in Messenger:\n- Use the\nMessenger for logged-in users\nto ensure audience targeting functions properly. This is critical for differentiating user types.\nDefine Custom Data Attributes:\n- Set specific\ndata attributes\nor conditions (e.g., \u2018Web sessions is less than 3\u2019) to target users based on behavior or activity. For instance, you can segment users who have visited the platform fewer than three times.\nConfigure a Login Link in Privacy Settings:\n- In Settings > Help Center > Configure & style > Privacy, provide a login link to restrict access to certain articles. This ensures that restricted articles prompt users to log in before viewing.\nWhat Article related events does Intercom automatically track?\nWe track Article Content View, Click and Reaction, Reply and Educate Search Event (search article or collection viewed).\nCan I link to a search?\nIf you want to have a link on your website which when clicked will bring the user to a page of search results on Articles for a given term, you can do so using this query string:\nhttps://docs.intercom.com/#search_query=%s\nJust replace the\n%s\nwith whatever term you want to search for. The search query will need to be URL encoded before it can be used.\nI'd like the links to other help center articles to open in a new tab by default. Is there a way to do this?\nHelp Center article links open in the same tab when it's on the same domain as the current page, so if you are hyperlinking to another article in your Help Center, it will always open in the same tab. Links will open in a new tab if it's on a different domain. However, there are a couple of workarounds you can try:\nAdd a button\nto your public article with a link to the article in your Help Center. When customers click on the button it should open the article in a new tab (even if it's on the same domain).\nUse a URL shortener like\nBitly\nto create links to articles that are considered on a \"different domain\", to allow it to open in a new tab.\nCan I track a user's session between my app and the Help Center?\nBy default, our customers' Help Centers are made available at\nhttps://intercom.help/example\n. This is a different domain (intercom.help) to the domain hosting the Intercom app (e.g.\napp.example.com\n). This means that web messenger sessions don't carry between the two websites because the cookies we use to track session information can't be shared between different domains. As a result, a user who is logged in at\nhttp://app.example.com\nwill appear as a visitor/lead for all their interactions with\nhttp://intercom.help/example\n.\nTo work around this, customers should set up a custom domain for their Help Center that lines up with their app's domain (e.g.\ndocs.example.com\nfor\napp.example.com\n). Once the \"organisational domain\" (e.g. the\nexample.com\npiece of the domain) lines up between the two, cookies will pass between them and sessions will carry. Details on setting up a custom domain can be found in our\ndeveloper docs\n.\nCan I use HTML, CSS or iFrames to customize the Help Center and embed in Articles?\nNo, it's currently not possible to use HTML, CSS or iFrames to customize Articles or the Help Center. This feature is not planned for the near future however you can upvote, comment and subscribe to this feature request in our\nProduct Wishlist\n.\nCan I add internal notes for Articles?\nNo, it's currently not possible to add internal notes to articles and this is not planned for the near future. You can upvote, comment and subscribe to this feature request in our\nProduct Wishlist\n.\nCan I add metadata tags to my Articles?\nNo, it's currently not possible to add metadata tags to articles and this is not planned for the near future. You can upvote, comment and subscribe to this feature request in our\nProduct Wishlist.\nSEO\nDo I need a sitemap?\nIf you had a site map on your old help site, don\u2019t worry: your Help Center is designed so that it doesn\u2019t need one. Google can crawl your Help Center without a site map.\nCan I upload my own robots.txt file?\nIt isn't currently possible to upload a custom \"\nrobots.txt\n\" file to the Help Center.\nHow can I ensure Google is indexing my Help Center?\nAll Google - or any search engine - needs is to encounter a link to any page in your Help Center.\nMost teams link to their Help Center from their marketing site. Google can index your whole Help Center starting with that link.\nWhile you can\nsubmit your URL to Google Search Console directly\n, you don\u2019t need to. \u2014 Google regularly crawls the web to add new sites to its index.\nAll our pages include metadata tags that search engines use to index content:\nOur pages also include OpenGraph metadata. This is useful when sharing links on social media (X (formerly Twitter) / Facebook / Slack etc.). Search engines probably don't care, but worth mentioning.\nWe use the canonical link metadata tag. So if you include `\nutm_source\n` or other query string parameters in your URL, or if you have a custom domain and someone accesses your intercom.help Help Center, the search engine will know what the canonical URL is for this content:\nIf you are having issues with google not indexing your Help Center and you have a custom domain, ensure you have HTTPS set up correctly. You can find the troubleshooting steps\nhere\n.\n\u200b\nYou can also choose to\ndisable search engine indexing and keep your articles private\n.\nDoes Articles support 301 redirects?\nYes, if you're importing or\nmigrating articles from Zendesk\nto Intercom, redirects are automatically implemented in the form of permanent redirects (\nHTTP 301 responses\n). This ensures that any existing article links do not break after migration, preserving their SEO score.\nYou can also manually create, edit, or delete redirects with the\nManage Redirects\nfeature.\nHow else can I improve my Help Center's SEO?\nKnow the words your customers use to ask for help with your product, whether it's on Google or in your Help Center. With Articles, you can\nsee what terms customers searched for most but didn\u2019t find\n. Work those phrases into your:\nArticle title\n- Clear, action based titles work best like, \u2018Collaborate together on projects.\u2019 Once you publish your article, the collection it belongs to and the section it\u2019s in will also appear in the URL.\nArticle description\n- This should set your customers\u2019 expectations for what the article contains, and how it can help. Keep this short and to the point, like \u2018Work with teammates to reach your deadline on time.\u2019\nLink text\n- Writing link text that says \u2018click here\u2019 or \u2018find out more\u2019 is a wasted opportunity. When linking to related articles, include keywords customers are likely to search for.\nCustom Domains\nHow do I set up audience targeting for Help Center articles and restrict access to certain articles using a custom domain?\nIn order for Audience Targeting to function appropriately, you will need to be using the Messenger in your product for logged in users, as well as having a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. This setup ensures that we are able to tell the difference between a logged-in user and a visitor or lead. You can find the instructions to set this up\nhere\n. After this has been set up, you can enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings > \"Privacy\" by configuring a login link that will encourage people to log in when they've attempted to view an article that is only available for Users. Additionally, once you have the proper set up with a custom domain, all customers will be redirected to your custom domain once they access default URL links, and they won't be able to see the restricted article at all.\nTroubleshooting\nHow do I create an article in a different language in the help center and resolve the error\n\"Make sure that you fill in all titles\"\n?\nTo create an article in a different language and resolve the error\n\"Make sure that you fill in all titles\"\n, follow these steps:\nAdd the desired language as an\nadditional language\nin the help center settings.\nAdd a translation of the\npage title\nto the help center header for each language.\nSave your help center settings.\nBy completing these steps, you should be able to create an article in the desired language without encountering the error.\nAn error occured while trying to publish your article. Please try again.\nThis error can occur when trying to publish a public article if there is no teammate selected for the \"Written by\" field (i.e. the original author was a teammate who has been removed from your workspace). To fix it, simply open the article in edit mode and select a new teammate from the \"Written by\" dropdown in the\nDetails\npanel and then try click\nPublish\nagain.\nHow can I resolve issues when saving an article in Knowledge?\nIf you're experiencing difficulties saving an article, here are some general troubleshooting steps you can follow:\nTry saving the article as a draft first before publishing.\nRemove images from the article one by one to identify if a specific image is causing the issue.\nLog out and log back in to your Intercom account.\nWhen Using YouTube Videos, ensure you're using the correct embed URL format:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/[VIDEO_ID]\nUse the video embedding tool in the editor's toolbar for proper video insertion.\nIf you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, there might be a technical problem that needs further investigation.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nImport public articles from Zendesk\nMessenger FAQs\nSync public articles with Zendesk\nGetting started FAQs\nEmail customization FAQs"},

By default, your customers can send attachments (including images) via the Messenger, email, API, and Facebook.\nHow do attachments work?\nWhen uploaded, attachments become linked attachments, which is standard treatment for email and message deliverability purposes. By default, linked attachments are not indexed by search engines and are not predictable. However, you should take care not to share linked attachments publicly.\nWhile uploading, attachments are scanned for harmful viruses, and if one is detected, then the file is quarantined and will not be accessible.\nPreviously all uploads were publicly accessible for 30 days if you had the URL. This had a potential to become a security risk, and to address that risk we have updated the expected behavior.\nThe expiry time for end-user uploads is now 30 minutes.\nFor teammates, the URLs that expire can be regenerated by simply reloading the page. For end-users, they can get a new URL by hitting the back button in the Messenger, and then clicking into the conversation again or by reloading the page.\nThe size limit on individual attachments is 100mb for uploads via Messenger and there is currently no limit on the number of attachments that can be uploaded.\nFor\nincoming emails\n, there is a size limit of 20mb\nincluding\nattachments.

They will be part of an attachment called Winmail.dat. You can read more about that\nhere\n.\nHow do I disable attachments?\nIf you'd like to disable the ability for customers to upload attachments, toggle off \"Allow leads and users to send attachments\" by going to\nSettings > Workspace > Security > Attachments:\nIf you disable attachments, the Messenger will not allow files to be dragged and dropped into the conversation, and will remove the attachments option:\nIf a customer sends you an email with an attachment, the attachment will not be processed.

If you\u2019re using Fin AI Agent, any\nresolutions\nover Slack will be billed through Intercom on your usual billing date.\nInstall Channeled app\nTo set up Slack as a support channel in Intercom, you\u2019ll need to install the Channeled app on your workspace.\nGo to\nSettings > Channels > Slack\nand select\nActivate Channeled.\nThis will take you to the Channeled app in the Intercom App Store where you can select\nInstall now\n(you\u2019ll need to be signed in to your Intercom workspace).\nNow click\nAuthenticate with Slack.\nAllow\npermission for Channeled to access your Slack workspace.\nCreate your first rule\nand click continue.

We recommend a few common defaults, like the \ud83c\udfab emoji or the \"help\" keyword.\nStep 3: Customize what happens when threads are escalated\nIf you've selected manual escalation  above, not every Slack thread becomes an Intercom conversation. Here, you'll be able to customize the response that occurs when conversations are created (like a success message, or a prompt for more info.). This can include a custom form that shows up in Slack, if you'd like.\nStep 4: Determine what happens when conversations are closed\nChanneled can optionally send a Slack-native CSAT prompt when conversations are closed from Intercom. You can configure whether CSAT is prompted and what the prompt looks like in Slack.\nConnecting Channels\nAfter installing Channeled, use\n/invite-channeled\nin any Slack channel within your workspace to enable channels to sync and escalate to Intercom.\nTip:\nTo check if you have the app added in a specific channel click on a channel name and look for Channeled under Integrations > Apps.\nTesting your integration\nIntercom requires conversations created from external contacts (not teammates), so you should test on a thread created by someone outside your own domain (e.g. a Gmail account) or external domain.\nGo to any connected channel and use the escalation setting you've configured above.\nIf you have automated syncing, conversations should instantly be created in Intercom from customer threads.\nIf you have manual syncing, you should see conversations created after using the escalation emoji or shortcut.\nRespond to Slack messages from the Inbox\nOnce Channeled is activated on your Intercom workspace, your customers can send messages through the Slack channel(s) you connected.\nThe new Slack thread will appear in your Intercom Inbox as a conversation. Reply directly to the message from the inbox, or access the Slack thread from the link shared in the conversation notes.\nWith your customer\u2019s Slack messages now in the Inbox, you can:\nTrigger powerful workflows\nand automation to effectively assign, manage, and respond to conversations from one place.\nLet Fin respond\nto customers over Slack (to enable this feature, reach out to your Intercom or Channeled Account Manager).\nFin over Slack follows the same configuration (e.g. audience rules and handover) that you've set up for\nFin over chat\nand/or your\nworkflow with Fin\n, and will follow any\nFin Guidance\nthat has been applied.\nFAQs\nCan I integrate Channeled CSAT with Intercom conversation ratings?\nNo, this is not possible. Intercom\u2019s API doesn\u2019t allow editing of conversation_rating, which prevents direct integration.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Channeled automated escalation and custom escalation?\nAutomated escalation\n: Every thread automatically becomes an Intercom conversation instantly.\nCustom escalation\n: You can manually trigger escalation using an emoji, @mention, or keyword.\nLearn more about configuring escalations in Channeled\n.\nHow do I create Slack forms for conversation creation?\nChanneled provides a drag-and-drop configuration tool for\ncreating Slack forms\n, making it easy to set up conversation creation from Slack to Intercom.\nCan I support customers on Slack?\nYes, if you want to connect Slack as a support channel in Intercom, you can use our\nChanneled integration\nwhich allows customers to reach out to you on Slack and routes these conversations directly to your Intercom Inbox, enabling you to handle your Slack support from one place.\nHowever, if you're just wanting to notify your teams in Slack about conversation and ticket activity, simply use our\nSlack app\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nConnect your Facebook channel\nConnect your WhatsApp channel\nConnect your Instagram channel\nSlack app\nChannels explained"},

Check that the person has correct permissions in the Facebook Page\nIn the settings of the Facebook Page connected to the Instagram business account, if they go to the\nPage Settings\nsection, the person should appear with a role of Moderator, Editor or Admin. More about roles in\nMeta documentation\n3. Check that Intercom Facebook App has correct permissions in the Facebook Page\nIn Facebook Page > Settings >\nAdvanced messaging\n, the Intercom Facebook App should have at least these Instagram permissions:\ninstagram_basic\nand\ninstagram_manage_messages\n.\n4.

You can leverage Series in Intercom to set this type of workflow up.\nUse SMS to re-engage your customers\nThough email has a time and place in any re-engagement strategy, that channel has become highly congested and there\u2019s a good chance your customers will overlook messages sent via email.

According to Meta's own guidelines, it is no longer possible to change the currency for a WABA once it has been set during creation. Meta also generally requires your WABA's currency to match your business\u2019s region (for example, businesses in Italy uses Euro).\nFor compatibility with Intercom's integration, we currently require all connected WhatsApp Business Accounts to be set to USD. Therefore, if you are setting up a new WABA specifically for use with Intercom, you will need to ensure its currency is set to USD during the creation process to match our integration's requirements. If your existing WABA is not in USD and you wish to connect it to Intercom, you will need to create a new WABA with USD as its currency and migrate your phone number(s) to it.\nThis limitation regarding the inability to change currency after creation is enforced by Meta and is outside of Intercom's control.\nBefore you get started\nIf you are already using the WhatsApp mobile app or WhatsApp Business mobile app with the phone number you want to use in Intercom, you'll need to delete your account in the app first before you can use that phone number with Intercom.

This setup happens in your DNS provider.\nDNS records you\u2019ll add\nWhen authenticating your domain manually, you\u2019ll be given:\nTwo CNAME records\n(for DKIM and custom return-path)\nOne TXT record\n(for DMARC)\nYour DNS provider might call these fields differently:\nHost / Name\n\u2192 use the \"Name\" from Intercom\nTarget / Value\n\u2192 use the \"Value\" from Intercom\nNote:\nMake sure your domain name isn't added twice in the \"Name\" field. Some DNS systems add it automatically.\nTip:\nSee steps for common DNS providers here\n.\nVerifying authentication\nAfter you\u2019ve added the DNS records:\nWait for changes to propagate (can take up to\n72 hours\n).\nGo back to your\nIntercom email settings\nand click\nFinish setup\n.\nClick\nValidate authentication\n.\nIf it doesn\u2019t verify immediately, wait a bit and try again. DNS propagation is the most common reason for delays.\nDNS propagation, the process of updating DNS records across the internet, usually takes between a few hours and 24-48 hours. However, in some cases, it can take up to 72 hours. Several factors influence this time, including your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your domain's registry, and the Time to Live (TTL) values of your DNS records.\nCommon setup issues and how to fix them\n1. Missing or Incorrect DNS Records\nMake sure all required records (two CNAMEs + one TXT) are added exactly as provided.\n2. Using the Wrong Record Type\nDKIM and Return-Path setup requires\nCNAME\n, not TXT.\n3. Cloudflare or GoDaddy Users\nThese providers sometimes require special settings:\nCloudflare\n: Turn off proxying (the cloud icon should be\ngrey\n, not orange).\nGoDaddy\n: Enter the \"Name\" and \"Value\" exactly as shown, without trailing dots.\n4. CNAME Flattening Issues (Cloudflare only)\nMake sure the record is set to\nDNS Only\n, not proxied.\n5. DNS Propagation Delay\nIt can take several hours for DNS changes to fully take effect across the internet. If verification fails, give it more time before retrying.\nTools to help you check your setup\nYou can use these public tools to check if your DKIM record is live:\n\ud83d\udd17\nDKIM Core Key Checker\nSelector\n:\nintercom\nDomain\n: yourdomain.com\n\ud83d\udd17\nMXToolbox DKIM Lookup\nNote:\nYou'll still need to click\nVerify authentication\nin Intercom even if your DKIM record is showing as live.\nAbout SPF and DMARC\nDo I need to configure SPF?\nNo. Intercom handles SPF for you by setting a custom return-path on all emails we send. You don\u2019t need to add your own SPF record unless advised otherwise.\nShould I set up DMARC?\nYes, especially if:\nYou send more than 5,000 emails per day (required by Google and Yahoo).\nYou want added protection against spoofing.\nIntercom supports DMARC fully when DKIM and return-path records are correctly configured.\nStill having issues?\nIf you've tried all these troubleshooting steps and are still encountering problems:\nDouble-check that at least one email address using your domain is verified in your Intercom account. You can do this from\nSettings > Channels > Email > Domains & addresses\nby adding a new address or editing an existing one. During the email address setup you'll be sent a verification email. You can request a new one by clicking\nResend verification email.\nDouble-check for typos or formatting differences in your\nDNS records\n.\nEnsure you\u2019re not using conflicting TXT and CNAME records for the same name.\nEnsure you've clicked\nVerify authentication\nin Intercom after setting up your DNS records.\nSpeak to our support team for further assistance.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nTroubleshooting custom domain set up and HTTPS/SSL\nUse a custom domain for email assets\nYour guide to Google & Yahoo\u2019s new requirements for email senders\nIntercom developer FAQs\nConnect your email support channel"},

This allows your email assets (links, images, unsubscribe links, teammate uploads) to appear to be from your custom domain.\nBy default, all emails sent from Intercom with email assets have URLs that reference Intercom and the workspace name. This means that when a customer receives an email and hovers over a link, they will see something like this:\nworkspace-name.intercom-clicks.com/via/e?ob=ABCtbSGfo5%2i1t8ifgl_0123\nConfiguring link branding makes emails look more credible: customers might be less hesitant to click on links when they see your company name in the link. Additionally, email service providers scan these links to determine whether the email looks trustworthy enough to deliver.\nBy implementing link branding, you gain more control over deliverability of your emails as they would no longer rely on a domain that is owned by Intercom and that you don\u2019t control (intercom-clicks.com).\nGet started\nYou can configure link branding for emails in\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\n.\nScroll down to the \"Link branding\" section and click on\nConfigure link branding.\nThen follow the steps on screen:\nSign in to your domain provider's website.

You can also update the domain with a new one.\nPeriodically checking if the custom domain is valid\nFor workspaces that have link branding set up, we periodically check whether the custom asset domain is valid, because the SSL certificate associated with the domain can expire or be removed.\nIf this periodic check fails, we will display an error banner in the Email composer and the Link branding page.\nError banner in the Outbound email composer:\nError banner in the link branding settings page:\nYou can manually run a check by clicking the\nCheck status\nbutton in the banner on the link branding settings page. If it is successful, the error will resolve.

This will let you handle all email support requests from one place, while making use of automations such as assigning to team inboxes, applying SLAs, etc.\nBefore you get started\nAdmin access to your email provider and domain settings are required for automatic forwarding and domain setup.\nInvite your admin to Intercom\n.\nAutomatic forwarding is a feature that is found in almost all email providers. However, email providers have different settings and capabilities that can affect, for example, whether or not spam is filtered out before emails are forwarded, or how many emails can be forward per day. Below we outline some guidance for setting up automatic forwarding with some major email providers, but we recommend reading the documentation for your email provider before getting started.\nAvoid using mailing lists for email forwarding:\nMailing lists, such as Google Groups, are not suitable for forwarding emails to Intercom. These platforms often modify the \u201cFrom\u201d address in the email header, which prevents correctly associating the email with the right contact in Intercom. This is designed to protect against user impersonation.\nSet up automatic email forwarding\nYou can set up multiple email addresses for forwarding into Intercom. After setting up the first address, simply repeat the process for any additional addresses. Keep in mind the following limits:\nYou can add up to 10 unverified email addresses at a time.\nA maximum of 250 email addresses can be added to your Intercom workspace.\nAutomatic email forwarding can be set up when adding a new email address to Intercom:\nGo to\nSettings > Channels > Email > Domains & addresses\nand select\nNew email address.\nEnsure \"Automatically forward emails from this address\" is enabled.\nCopy your workspace email provided.\nFollow the steps to set up email forwarding for your\nemail provider\n(see below).\nVerify automatic forwarding.\nFinishing\nsetting up your email address\nin Intercom.\nOr, when editing an email address you've already added in Intercom:\nGo to\nSettings > Channels > Email > Domains & addresses\nand select\nEdit\nnext to the email address you've added.\nThen click\nSet up automatic forwarding.\nCopy your workspace email provided.\nFollow the steps to set up email forwarding for your\nemail provider\n(see below).\nVerify automatic forwarding.\nAfter successfully setting up automatic email forwarding, the next step is to authenticate your domain if it hasn\u2019t already been authenticated. Domain authentication is essential for proper email forwarding as without it, forwarded emails may fail verification in Intercom.\nNote:\nYour domain or email provider may require you verify ownership of the forwarding address. Typically, they send a verification email which can be found in your\nunassigned inbox\n.\nVerifying your automatic forwarding setup is an essential step and cannot be skipped, it confirms that you own the forwarding address necessary for security and helps maintain your domain reputation by preventing bounces.\nWhen you initially set up your forwarding email, your email client may send a verification email to Intercom to confirm you have access to the address you are forwarding to (Intercom). This verification email can sometimes end up in your Spam inbox. If the Spam Inbox is not visible, you can find it by going to\nManage\n>\nEdit sidebar\n> Spam and then pin it to the Sidebar:\nWhen you forward your email into Intercom, every member of your team will be able to see any emails sent to you. As a result, if you have private emails you don't want visible in Intercom it's not advisable to forward emails from your personal address.\nEmail provider instructions\nRefer to the instructions for your email provider below to begin forwarding email to Intercom.\nConfigure email forwarding in Google Workspace\nThis approach is recommended for forwarding from Google because it doesn\u2019t have rate limits or require a mailbox to be created. You\u2019ll need administrator access to set it up.\nProvider instructions:\nForward email to a third-party CRM\nStep by step instructions:\nLog into your Google Workspace Admin Console by visiting\nhttps://admin.google.com/\nand signing in with your admin credentials.\nIn your admin dashboard, select\nApps\n, then select\nGmail\n.\nOn the Gmail settings page, locate the \"Default Routing\" section and select\nConfigure\nto create a new routing rule.\nIn the \"Add Setting\" modal (Step 1), specify the envelope recipient. Enter the support email address your customers use to contact you such as\nsupport@yourcompany.com\nin the email address field.\nScroll down to the \"Envelope Recipient\" section. Choose\nChange Envelope Recipient\n, then select\nReplace Recipient\n. In the Replace Recipient field, paste your Intercom forwarding address that you copied from Intercom\u2019s email forwarding instructions.\nSave\nyour changes in the Google Workspace Admin Console.\nNow\nEdit\nthe rule you created and make sure that the setting under the \"Options\" section is set to:\n\"Perform this action on non-recognized and recognized addresses.\"\nReturn to Intercom and select\nVerify automatic forwarding\n.\nNote:\nChanges to your Google forwarding settings can take up to 24 hours but typically happen more quickly.\nConfigure email forwarding in Microsoft 365\nProvider instructions:\nConfigure email forwarding in Microsoft 365\nStep by step instructions:\nLog into your Microsoft 365 Admin Center by visiting\nhttps://admin.microsoft.com/\nand signing in with your admin credentials.\nSelect the mailbox that you wish to configure forwarding for:\nShared mailbox:\nOn the admin center homepage, go to the Teams & groups > Shared mailboxes page. Select the mailbox, then select\nEdit\nin the \"Email forwarding\" section.\nUser:\nOn the admin center homepage, go to the Users > Active users page. Select the user, then the mail tab and select\nManage email forwarding\nin the \"Email forwarding\" section.\nOn the \"Shared mailbox\" email forwarding side panel, select the \"Forward all email sent to this mailbox\" checkbox.\nThen enter your Intercom forwarding address that you copied from Intercom\u2019s email forwarding instructions and select\nSave\nand exit the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.\nReturn to Intercom and select\nVerify automatic forwarding\n.\nNote:\nAutomatic forwarding needs to be enabled in your anti-spam outbound policy before trying to verify your forwarding setup. This is found in the\nMicrosoft Defender portal\n.\nImportant:\nAll email forwarding configurations must be performed via the\nMicrosoft 365 Admin Center\nand not through Outlook on the web (OWA).\nConfigure email forwarding in other providers\nThese methods are suitable for\nlow volume forwarding only\n. Rate limits could result in messages being slowed or the account being denylisted if they are exceeded.\nProvider instructions:\nGmail\nOutlook\niCloud Mail\nNote:\nGoogle limits\nthe number of Gmail messages users can send per day, and the number of recipients per message.\nUsing the email forwarding setting with Outlook will forward the emails as if you are the original sender. You should use the\nredirect option\ninstead which will preserve the original sender.\nFAQs and troubleshooting email forwarding issues\nMy email forwarding suddenly stopped working\nIf your email forwarding stops working completely, likely someone in your company has disabled the forwarding in the email provider of the forwarding address. The first step here is to log into the email provider and check that you have Intercom's default \"Workspace email address\" added to your email forwarding settings for your external email client and that the forwarding has been enabled. To locate your default workspace email address in Intercom, navigate to\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\n. Ensure this address is correctly added to your forwarding settings with no typos.\nYou can also test your email forwarding in Intercom using the \"Check automatic forwarding\" when editing an address in your\nDomains & Addresses settings\nin Intercom to confirm if the forwarding setup is operational. If your email forwarding is correctly enabled, check if any filters or restrictions have been created in the forwarding setup of your email provider which could block emails from being forwarded to Intercom, e.g. only forward emails with a specific Subject line or with keywords.\nCommon causes for forwarding failures include:\nMissing or incorrect Intercom email address in forwarding settings.\nForwarding option being disabled in your email client.\nIncorrect configuration settings in your email provider.\nMissing some forwarded emails\nIf you have email forwarding enabled and notice that some emails cannot be found within your Intercom Inbox, there's a few things to check here:\nUse the\nInbox search\nin case the email got assigned to a specific team or teammate.\n\u200b\nCheck if the email went to spam in your email client. If it did, it will not be automatically forwarded. Email clients do not forward an email when you click \"not spam\". You will need to manually forward this to Intercom.\n\u200b\nNext, check your Intercom spam folder. Intercom has\nbuilt-in spam filtering\nin addition to that provided by your email client. If you\u2019re missing messages that you think have been incorrectly filtered, you can check for them in the\nSpam Inbox\n.\nTo remove spam emails from this spam folder, you can press \"not spam\" on these messages, which will bring them back to the normal inbox.\n\u200b\nCheck the size of the email in your email client. Intercom has a 20MB limit on incoming email content. Any email larger than 20MB will be rejected. - This limit includes attachments.\n\u200b\nThe last action is to check if a forwarding event actually happened for the specific email. You will need your email administrator to check this for you.\n\u200b\nIf you have proof of forwarding and the email does not appear in Intercom, speak to our Support team and provide the following info:\nSubject line of the missing email.\nTimestamp the email was received at.\nThe email address of the user and the email address it was sent to.\nThe users email is not being added as a participant to the conversation\nThere are a few cases where this can happen:\nIf you manually forwarded an email to Intercom, then the address that did the forward action will be picked up as the sender of the email. You can prevent this from happening by enabling the end-user detection in forwarded emails. To enable this, go to\nSettings > Email > Email settings\nand scroll down to the \"Detect customers in forwarded emails\" setting to toggle this\non.\n\u200b\nThis issue can also happen if you set up your email forwarding through Google Groups or another mailing list provider, which is not supported.\nThe original user is not added as the participant in the conversation when an email generated from a contact form\nIntercom uses the \"From\"\nfield of an email to identify the sender of an email and adds them as a participant to the conversation.\nSometimes, with contact forms or some email forwarding configurations, the sender may be changed to the account doing the forwarding, instead of the original sender (or the email entered into the contact form).\nRather than forwarding your completed contact forms via email forwarding, we recommend\nusing our REST API\nto create conversations directly in Intercom when the form has been completed.\nCan I forward email to an individual teammate in Intercom instead of the workspace address?\nYes, you can also automatically forward email to a specific teammate in Intercom. To do this, copy the unique email address listed on their teammate profile (you can access a teammate's profile by clicking on their name from\nSettings > Workspace > Teammates\n).\nHow do I disable email forwarding to Intercom?\nIf you wish to disconnect your email forwarding from Intercom, you need to disable the email forwarding in your email provider's settings.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSend outbound email from your own address\nEmail sending restrictions explained\nAccept an invite to an Intercom workspace\nDetect customers in forwarded emails\nConnect your email support channel"},

Connecting your domain improves the deliverability and trustworthiness of your emails. It helps with: email authentication; DMARC (to protect against spoofing); and brand trust (emails sent from your own domain create brand awareness and legitimacy).\nGet started\nGo to\nSettings > Channels > Email\nwhere you'll find your\nDomains & addresses\n.\nStep 1: Add an email address\nBegin by selecting\nNew email address\n. You\u2019ll then be prompted to enter the support email address your customers use to reach you. For example, if customers contact you at\nsupport@yourcompany.com\n, enter\nsupport@yourcompany.com\n.\nNote:\nYou must enter a work email. Emails forwarded from a personal email address with domains such @gmail.com or @outlook.com aren't supported.\nIf you have\nmultiple brands\nin Intercom, you can choose which brand the emails sent to and from this address should use.\nStep 2: Set up automatic email forwarding\noptional\nYou can choose to \"Automatically forward emails from this address\" by enabling this option in the email setup.\nTurn this off and\nskip to domain authentication\nif you don\u2019t want to set up email forwarding but you do want to send\nOutbound messages\nfrom this address.\nConfiguring automatic email forwarding is a three-step process:\nClick set up automatic forwarding in the email setup flow.\nCopy your workspace email into your email provider\u2019s settings (\nsee instructions\n).\nVerify automatic forwarding.\nNote:\nVerifying your automatic forwarding setup is an essential step and cannot be skipped, it confirms that you own the forwarding address necessary for security and helps maintain your domain reputation by preventing bounces.\nLearn more about automatic forwarding\n.\nAfter successfully setting up automatic email forwarding, the next step is to authenticate your domain if it hasn\u2019t already been authenticated.\nStep 3: Authenticate your domain\nAuthenticating your domain will reduce bounce rates, prevent emails from landing in spam, and ensure your customers always recognize your email address.\nTo achieve this, we use DKIM to sign the messages we send on your behalf. Email clients can verify these signatures against the DNS record you set up for your domain.\nTogether with DNS records for custom return paths and the DMARC record, we're able to fully align the domains in the email header to assure recipient mail servers that Intercom is authorized by you to send emails for your domain. A custom return path record allows the email you send from Intercom to be SPF aligned for DMARC.\nWithout setting up your domain, you and your customers will see an\nUnauthenticated\nwarning, like this\ud83d\udc47\nUseful terminology\nDomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)\n- allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a recipient. The responsible organization adds a digital signature to the message, associating it with a domain name of that organization.\nSender Policy Framework (SPF)\n- checks if the sender of an email is legitimate. By having an SPF record, Internet Service Providers can ensure that a mail server is authorized to send emails for a specific domain. This record is a DNS TXT record, indicating which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain.\nDomain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)\n- is a tool that makes sure emails are genuine. It works with SPF and DKIM to strengthen email security. It sets rules for handling email issues and gives feedback to improve protection against fake emails for a domain.\nBegin domain authentication by\nverifying your email address\n. You can do this from\nSettings > Channels > Email > Domains & addresses\nby adding a new address or editing an existing one.\nDuring the email address setup you'll be sent a verification email. You can request a new one by clicking\nResend verification email.\nClick the link in the verification email, then return to this page and select\nAuthenticate your domain\nto find the CNAME and TXT records you need to add to your DNS settings.\nYou have two choices when it comes to how you add the required DNS records to your domain:\nYou can add the records\nautomatically\nthrough Entri, a third-party tool which will add the records to your DNS, or\nYou can do it\nmanually\nthrough your DNS provider\u2019s settings.\nAuthenticate automatically\nEntri is a third-party tool. It will find, connect and authenticate all your domain records for you, saving you time. To get started with Entri select\nAuthenticate automatically\nyou\u2019ll be prompted to select your domain provider. After Entri is finished analyzing your domain, you'll be prompted to log into your domain provider. Once Entri has verified that you own the domain and your credentials are correct it will add the records to your DNS.\nAuthenticate manually\nFor the manual process, you will need to sign into your domain provider then add the three DNS records provided by copying and pasting the \"Name\" and \"Value\" of each record as you create new records in your DNS. The exact method of adding DNS records depends on your domain provider (see below).\nAdd DNS records to your domain provider\nThe first CNAME record is used to configure DKIM on emails you send from Intercom. This allows the email you send from Intercom to be DKIM aligned for DMARC.\nThe second CNAME record is used to configure the\nreturn-path\naddress on emails you send from Intercom. This allows the email you send from Intercom to be SPF aligned for DMARC.\nThe TXT record is used to configure the DMARC policy on emails you send from your domain. This step is required by Google and Yahoo if you are sending more than 5,000 emails per day but we highly recommend it regardless of how much email you are currently sending as it\u2019ll help your email reach your customers\u2019 inboxes.\nNote:\nSome DNS providers may require the full domain name to be provided. For these providers, an example name of\nintercom._domainkey\nwill need to be entered simply as\nintercom._domainkey.example.com\n. Your DNS provider's documentation should provide details on their requirements.\nAuthenticating your domain via Cloudflare\nLog into your Cloudflare Admin by visiting\nhttps://dash.cloudflare.com/login\nand signing in with your admin credentials.\nFrom the homepage select the domain you want to authenticate by selecting its\nName\nfrom the domains table.

The workspace creator and the billing admin will always be notified by default and can't be removed from being notified.\nTeammates added to this list will be notified if email sending is paused, and your\nworkspace is under review\n.\nFAQs\nWhat happens when the conversation starts via Messenger chat and moves to email?\nIf the conversation starts through chat and the customer\u2019s email is found, the customer will receive an email notification when the teammate replies via the Inbox. The notification will come from your default address (e.g. support@company.com).\nIf you select\nYou\nas the \"From\" address when sending an outbound message, then the address you signed up to Intercom with will be used as the \"From\" address, e.g. yourname@company.com. After the customer replies and you send another email, the initial sender will be the kept as the \"From\" address.\nWhere will email notifications come from?\nEmail notifications are sent from the default email address selected in\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\n.\nDo I need to enable SPF?\nNo, Intercom handles that for you. Emails sent from Intercom include a return-path header. When a recipient mail server receives one of our emails and checks the SPF record of the domain in our return-path, they will see that our sending IP addresses are authorized senders.\nHowever, you should\ncreate a custom return-path record\nso that we can align the return path on the emails you send via Intercom with your domain.\nCan I enable DMARC for sending through Intercom?\nYes, you should. We strongly encourage enabling DMARC and we will highlight domains as unauthenticated in your workspace if DMARC is not enabled.\nA DMARC policy on your domain is one of the best mechanisms to combat email spoofing. It will tell recipient email servers how to handle emails which claim to come from your domain. If you believe there is a potential risk of spammers spoofing your domain, DMARC can help.\nFrom the 1st February 2024, it will be required by Google and Yahoo if you are sending more than 5,000 emails per day.\nWhat do I need to do to enable DMARC?\nDMARC checks that the domain in the \"From\" address of your emails matches the domain in your DKIM records or the domain in the return-path header. Once you've\nset up the CNAME records for Intercom\n, you're all set to create the DMARC record.\nThe simplest possible DMARC record is a _dmarc TXT record containing \u201cv=DMARC1; p=none\u201d. However, we encourage you to look into setting up DMARC reporting to a DMARC report analysis service as part of moving to a quarantine or reject policy. This will help protect your customers from spammers attempting to spoof your email address.\nFor domains with a DMARC policy and a valid DKIM and custom return path setup for Intercom, emails sent through our platform will pass DMARC without a problem.\nWhy do I need to enable DMARC?\nFrom the 1st February 2024, Yahoo and Google require DMARC if you are sending more than 5,000 emails per day. We recommends you do so regardless of how many emails you are sending.\nHow can I update the address on my existing auto messages?\nIf you want your existing ongoing messages to send from your newly created custom email address, you\u2019ll need to update the \"From\" address on each outbound message manually.\nWhy won't my DNS provider accept the provided CNAME?\nWhile we provide a DNS standard CNAME record, some providers do not allow it. Sometimes this is not allowed because of the '_' character.\nIf your domain provider doesn't accept the provided CNAME by default, try contacting them directly to ask if they'll add it for you.\nWe require using a CNAME because we may in future rotate our DKIM private keys. If we do this, having a CNAME record set up prevents disruption on your side.\nCan I send emails from a dedicated IP address?\nNo, at Intercom we use shared IPs with strict enforcement of thresholds and sending performance to ensure that our shared pools are healthy and incidents are kept rare.\nWe have found shared IPs to be low-risk and even beneficial for most senders when our\nemail sending guidelines\nare enforced. We actively take away sending rights from bad senders to reinforce this. If we find that one of our customers has poor sending performance and complaints of spam they will be blocked from email sending before they can cause global impact.\nAt Intercom we also use a variety of tools such as 250ok, MXToolbox, Microsoft SNDS, and Google Postmaster to monitor our sending reputation. We have our own in-house dashboards, monitoring, alarming and paging for any denylisting events so we can stay on top of any bad actors.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSend outbound email from your own address\nSet up a custom domain for your Help Center\nTroubleshooting custom domain set up and HTTPS/SSL\nYour guide to Google & Yahoo\u2019s new requirements for email senders\nTroubleshooting email authentication issues (DKIM, DMARC, and DNS Setup)"},

These improvements also give more control over what you communicate with customers, such as multilingual special notices and privacy policy.\nKey improvements\nWhile we recommend you read the whole article, the following are the main improvements:\nRedesigned Fin AI Agent answer cards.\nImproved conversation headers and greetings.\nLaunch directly into a conversation.\nClear labels and Fin to teammate handover.\nIntroduction of privacy policy notice.\nSpecial notices with multilingual support.\nRedesigned reply time expectations.\nRedesigned Fin AI Agent answer cards\nFin AI Agent answer cards have been redesigned with increased width, making it easier for customers to read the solution to their query. Customers can also choose to expand the Messenger on web from the top right corner.\nImproved conversation headers and greetings\nThe conversation experience in the Messenger has been simplified to focus on the content:\nConversations with Fin show Fin\u2019s name and avatar in the header and its first messages are the only element in the conversation.\nPrevious experience\nNew experience\nConversations with Workflows or no automation have been updated for a similar experience. However, you can still display a team introduction and special notice to set expectations with customers.\nPrevious experience\nNew experience\nAs the conversation progresses, displaying the team introduction and special notice will update in accordance with who/what the customer is interacting with at that time:\nInteracting with Fin\n- team introduction and special notice will not be shown.\nInteracting with a Workflow\n- team introduction and special notice will be shown.\nInteracting with a human\n- team introduction and special notice will be shown.\nLaunch directly into a conversation\nYou can now configure your Messenger to bypass the home screen and\nlaunch directly into the conversation\n.\nThis new setting ensures your customers have faster access to support, removing additional steps to starting a new chat with your team. This experience will maintain easy access to spaces such as help articles, previous conversations, and tickets.\nClear labels and handover\nWe\u2019ve made it easier to understand who is currently handling the conversation and whether it's been handed over from Fin AI Agent to teammate. Whether it\u2019s Fin, a workflow chatbot, or a human, your customer will know exactly who is providing a helping hand.\nFin AI Agent\nChatbot\nTeammate\nResponses from Fin AI Agent will be clearly labeled using your\nFin identity\n.\nResponses from chatbots in workflows will appear in a grey text bubble, with your\nbot identity\nand workspace name.\nResponses from your human support team will be clearly identified with their profile name and avatar.\n\u200b\nEverything in the conversation experience remains the same (i.e. any\nWorkflows\nyou've set up will work as normal).\nRedesigned reply time expectations\nYou can show reply times during\noffice hours\nand indicate when your team will be back online outside office hours. You an also enable \"Show office hours after team assignment\" to only show your office hours\nafter\na conversation is assigned to a team. We recommend this option if you have\nset office hours at the team level\n.\nIf you've enabled \u201cShare your typical reply time\u201d in\nSimple automations\n, this information will now be displayed at the appropriate times above the composer. Once the handover information is no longer necessary, like when a teammate responds, it will disappear.\nNote:\nThis is available on web and the latest Android SDK version (15.10.3) and iOS SDK version (18.5.0).\nIf the \u201cShare your typical reply time\u201d automation is not enabled, this handover information won't be shown.\nUsing the \u201cShow expected reply time\u201d action in a workflow will override the simple automation to avoid duplication.\nThe \u201cLeave a 2 minute delay before triggering the following during office hours\u201d setting in\nSimple automations\nis not honored by this handover notice.\nSpecial notices with multilingual support\nSpecial notices\ncan now be customized in multiple languages supported by your workspace, ensuring customers see notices in their preferred language. You can also enhance special notices with links and text styling for improved clarity and engagement.\nIntroduction of privacy policy notice\nA new privacy policy notice is now supported and can be configured through\nSettings > Messenger > General\n. The notice will appear at the start of each new conversation until the customer either sends a message or dismisses it.\nThe privacy policy notice supports multiple languages, text styling and hyperlinks and it's available on all platforms, including web and the latest versions of the iOS and Android SDKs.\nImportant changes for customers who were using the new Messenger beta:\nConversations will have a white background, prioritizing readability for your customers. You can still customize your Home space appearance (set background image or gradient etc.) however, the branded navigation bar from the new Messenger beta is no longer available.\nThe option to 'Show Help Center' as an icon in the Conversation space is no longer available. Instead, customers can access your Help Center from the Article search app or Help space (\nlearn more\n).\nThe three dot menu to access previous conversations is no longer available. Previous conversations can be accessed from the Home or Conversation space.\n\u200b\nFAQs\nDo I need to use Fin AI Agent to use the new Messenger experience?\nWhile the new Messenger experience is optimized for AI-first support with Fin AI Agent, you don\u2019t need to use Fin to use the new Messenger. It works well for conversational human support and\nWorkflow\npowered conversations too.\nDoes it cost extra to use the new Messenger experience?\nNo, the new Messenger experience is included in current pricing plans.\nCan I still use Home space apps?\nYes, apps in the Messenger Home space are supported in the new Messenger experience.\nWill my mobile apps get access to the Messenger improvements?\nTo ensure your customers benefit from these improvements in your mobile app, you must upgrade to the latest mobile SDK versions on iOS (version 18.5.0) and Android (version 15.13.0) and release an app update.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSupport customers during the holiday season\nSet up and customize the Messenger\nCustomize Fin AI Agent in the Messenger\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nUse Fin AI Agent in Workflows"},

There were simple rules for what happens when you match more than one of these at the same time and one content type never needed to know that another content type had been matched. The Messenger itself was responsible for deciding how to display multiple notifications, see Chats, Posts, Workflows.\nWith the introduction of Tours (also Carousels on mobile), Banners and now Surveys, we are starting to develop rules for what content types a customer can match at the same time and what content types a customer can match when they have \u201cactive\u201d content already.\nThere are 2 ways we can prioritize different content types:\nIn matching, where you simply can\u2019t match a certain content type if you also match one of the others (or already have an \u201cactive\u201d content type); or\nDisplay logic in the Messenger for when you do match multiple content types.\nWhen there are also matches for a...\nBanner\nCarousel\nChat\nWorkflow\nPost\nSurvey\nTour\nBanner\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\nn/a\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u274c\n\u2705\nCarousel\nn/a\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nn/a\nChat\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nWorkflow\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nPost\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nSurvey\n\u2705\n\u274c\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\n\u274c\nTour\n\u2705\nn/a\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\nn/a \u2014 Does not apply as these content types are only available on either web or mobile.\n1\ufe0f\u20e3  \u2014 The customer can match a single one of these content types at a time.\n\u274c \u2014 The customer cannot match one of these content types because there are matches for another content type.\n\u2705 \u2014 The customer can match this content type regardless of the other matches.\nIf a message has a start date, does it match the user when you set it live, or when the start date starts?\nThis is when the start date starts.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nRespond to users and visitors on the go with the Intercom Conversations App\nSMS in the Inbox\nTag conversations automatically with Workflows\nLoop teammates or teams into conversations\nMerging conversations and tickets"},

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/785641-why-hasn-t-a-user-received-my-message", "title": "Why hasn\u2019t a user received my message?", "content": "If a user who should have received a message hasn\u2019t, there could be a few reasons why. This troubleshooting guide will help you get to the heart of the problem.\nFirst, understand how each message gets delivered\nWe send\none-off messages\nimmediately (unless\nyou\u2019ve scheduled one\n). This means that we\u2019ll look for all the users who match your filters, and we\u2019ll send it as soon as we find them.\nFor\nongoing messages\n, we\ncheck once per hour\nto see who has become eligible to receive your messages.\nFor\nseries\n, Whenever a customer logs in to your app, or visits your website, and is tracked by Intercom, they\u2019ll enter any series where they match the entry rules for a path.\nIf they haven\u2019t logged in, entry rules are checked once an hour for anyone who should enter. Rule blocks in the middle of a path (when the customer has already entered the series) are checked approximately every 15 minutes.\nFor\nin-app messages (chats, posts etc)\n, we only deliver\nwhen a user is online to receive them\n. We will only match and send in-app messages when users \u201cping\u201d, i.e: when they are online and your app is sending us updates about them. The 'Last seen' value tells you when the user was last available on your site to receive a message.\nMessages which have a\npush notification\nattached to them will send immediately.\nNext, answer these questions\nIf you still haven't figured out why your message isn't sending, you'll need to answer the following questions:\nAre you sending the message to a large audience?\nMessages with a large audience might take some time for us to process. When you set a message live, we check all the message filters and see which of your users match them. The larger the message, the longer this processing can take to complete.\nDo users match the filters you\u2019ve set?\nIn Intercom, all messaging is trigger based. In other words, recipients have to match the\nfilters\nyou\u2019ve set on a message before they become eligible to receive it. Examples of filters would be \u201cSigned up less than 30 days ago\u201d and \u201cPlan is lite\u2019\nWhen you add filters to a message, these become the criteria that Intercom uses to check a users\u2019 eligibility for the message. For example, if you have a message set up with the filters above, it would look like this:\nCurrently no users match these filters, so no-one will receive the message. However, as it\u2019s an\nongoing message\n, Intercom will check every hour to see who matches these filters and it will send the message to any users who do.\nIf users match this message\u2019s filters, they will show on the right hand-side of the window. Here\u2019s how the message looks when people match the filters:\nHas that user unsubscribed?\nIf a user has unsubscribed from email messages from your app, they\nwon\u2019t receive any more bulk emails from you\n. They can still receive in-app messages and email messages sent only to them, however they won\u2019t receive any manual and automatic email messages.\nHas the message bounced?\nIf Intercom tries to send a message to a recipient and there is a permanent failure, also known as a hard bounce, we won\u2019t attempt email deliveries to that recipient again. This is because it\u2019s dangerous to continually attempt delivery to hard bounced addresses and it can harm your sending reputation and ability to get messages to the email inbox.\nHas that user marked the message as spam?\nEqually, if a recipient marks one of your emails as spam, you won\u2019t be able to send them any more emails from your Intercom app.\nUsers who are unsubscribed, bounced or who have marked your messages as spam will automatically be removed from the audience of bulk messages. If you try to send a message to someone who has previously bounced or complained, Intercom won\u2019t attempt delivery.\nCertain addresses are not meant to receive marketing email, and are automatically deemed ineligible to receive email. Examples include abuse@ and postmaster@ addresses.\nIf you try to send a message and all the recipients are ineligible to receive it, you might see a message which says: \u201cwe\u2019re preparing this email and it\u2019ll start sending shortly.\"\nNote:\nIf a user or lead's \"marked as spam\" attribute is 'true' but you have gotten written or verbal consent from them to receive emails from you again, reach out to our support team who can help update the user for you. It's important that you gain consent from the user/lead first, since emailing people who continue to mark your emails as spam can harm your sender reputation and increase the likelihood of your emails being routed to customers' spam filters.\nHave you scheduled your message to send inside a delivery window?\nIf you\u2019ve scheduled your messages to send at a certain time or inside a delivery window, that might delay delivery. For example, you might want to set a message live at 9am in another timezone while you\u2019re fast asleep - you can schedule a message to do this.\nYou can also set up\ndelivery windows\n, which might affect delivery times for messages. If you have a message with a delivery window of 9am to 5pm, it will deliver when it falls within that time window in the recipient\u2019s time zone.

Just click the icon on the right of the text block on the composer.\nHere are some useful examples:\nFirst name\nYou can greet each user by their first name. We'll automatically add this at the beginning of each message for you, because it's best practice. It's easy to remove it if you don't need it.\nCompany name\nOr you could add the company name. If you\u2019re looking for feedback about your product, for example, we recommend addressing the company by their first name. They\u2019re more likely to respond to a personal message sent to a select number of companies, than an impersonal message sent to everyone.\nNote:\nIf a user is a member of multiple companies, messages using company name will be sent to them once for each company.\nAdd custom attributes and events\nYou can even include\ncustom attributes\nor\nevents\nin your message, so that the information displayed is specific to each user. Maybe that\u2019s the number of songs a user has created, the number of teammates they\u2019ve added or the number of times they\u2019ve logged into your product. This is a great way to let customers know that they\u2019re about to reach a limit.\nOr you can display their achievements and celebrate their progress. For example, displaying the number of projects a user has created might spur them on to achieve even more success.\nFallbacks\nA lot of the time it's a good idea to replace the fallback variable with another word, in case the information is not available for a particular user. For example, if you add \"Hi <first name>\" at the beginning of your message and use the fall back as \"there\", it will say \"Hi John\" if we know John's name but it will say \"Hi there\" if we don't.\nJust click any variable you\u2019ve added, and you\u2019ll be able to include a fallback.\nYou can also\nadd variables to email messages you send to customers\n.\nNote:\nIf you send Intercom an attribute to include in a link, we'll take care of the encoding.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nKnow every user and company personally\nCreate HTML email templates\nUnderstand your outbound message stats\nCelebrate customer progress\nOutbound WhatsApp messages"},

If you'd like export conversations initiated by customers,\nread this article on exporting conversation data\n.\nThe date range selected here will filter the report to show messages which have sent in that period, but individual stats for those messages (like click rate etc) will show the results for\nall time\n.\nThe link that is sent out to download the CSV is only valid for 2 days, and will then expire.\nNote:\nIf you choose a date range that might contain a high volume of data, it\u2019s best to open the CSV file using a text editor.\nLastly, click\nExport Data\nand you'll receive the CSV file to your email address.\nExporting your message data can take up to a few hours.

They\u2019re not available for one-off messages.\nSee our plans and pricing here\nfor more details.\nCreate a control group\nOnce you\u2019re finished writing your message, click\nRun a new test\n.

Here are some tips for reviewing and optimizing your messages:\n1. Highlight your most impactful messages\nYou should highlight any impactful messages. For example, if a higher percentage of users who received the message are hitting your goal compared to the percentage of users in your control group, you can likely attribute the lift in your goal\u2019s performance to your message itself.\nOnce you know your message is a success, you can go ahead and:\nShowcase/report on these messages to upper management to prove the impact of your work.\nIdentify patterns in what makes a truly impactful message and xxx.\n2. Flag the least impactful messages\nYou should also flag any messages that don\u2019t appear to be impactful. For example, if the same percentage of users in the control group hit your goal compared to the percentage of users who got the message, it might not be the message that\u2019s causing your customers to take action.\nWe recommend, first making changes to the message - for example, you can tweak the copy or the call to action to see if your messages\u2019 performance improves.\nIf your message still isn\u2019t bringing the results you want, you should consider replacing it with a more impactful message. Your message real estate is precious, and you should only send the most impactful and helpful messages to your customers.\nCan I delete a control group I\u2019ve set up?\nYes, but there two things to note:\nIf you delete a control group, your message stats will be deleted.\nAnd the users in the control group will not receive the message.\nImportant:\nOnce you delete a control group, it's not possible to restore it.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nMeasure message effectiveness with goals\nUnderstand your outbound message stats\nKeep track of message changes and performance\nTest different paths with multivariate split testing in Series\nA/B test different message variations"},

Below, we\u2019ll show you how to create engaging and relevant messages to educate and inspire your customers to take the action you want.\nGet clear on what you\u2019re trying to achieve\nBefore you start writing your message, you need to be clear on why you\u2019re sending it. We recommend\nsetting a goal\nin Intercom to track the action you want your customers to take after reading your message.\nPro tip:\nIf you\u2019d like your customers to hit an important goal like upgrading to a paid account or becoming pro users of your app, you should\ncreate a series.\nSeries let you send a series of email, chat, post, and mobile push messages to help customers hit a common goal.\nChoose the right message channel\nNext, decide where it's most useful for customers to get your message.\nChat or post messages\nare great for encouraging customers to take action while they\u2019re using your app.\nEmail\nis the perfect channel for re-engaging inactive customers and bringing them back into your app.\nMobile push messages\nare ideal for deep linking customers to specific locations in your mobile app.\nShare content when and where it matters\nWhenever possible, share content in context. For example, if you want to share the new article you wrote all about how to use your calendar feature, share it in your app, when your user is on your calendar page.\nTo set this up, just choose chat or post as your channel and deliver it to \u2018web first.' Then, under \u2018where to send this\u2019 enter the URL you\u2019d like to target.\nNow that you know where you\u2019d like to reach your customers, it\u2019s time to create your messages. To truly engage your customers, share content that will:\nEducate your users about your product\nShare relevant, useful advice inside your app while your customers are using your product. Include tips inside the message itself or link to a best practice video or doc, for example.\nKeep your users up to date with new product releases\nAnnounce new feature and product updates\nthat will help your customers do their jobs better. Not only is this a great way to engage active users of your product, it also helps you stop inactive customers from slipping away.\nImprove your users' experience with your product\nYour messages should guide your customers through your product and highlight your most important features gradually. For example, right after your customers create their first project, they\u2019ll want to know what\u2019s next. Link them to the next important step to help them get the most value from your product.\nHow to say it\nWhat you say is only one piece of the puzzle. If you don\u2019t speak to your customers in the right way, you\u2019ll never inspire them to take action. Here\u2019s some powerful tips for making your customers feel valued, excited and motivated:\nKeep your tone friendly and mirror your customers\u2019 language. Speak like a human, not a machine.\nHighlight the benefits your customers will gain by taking action.\nFocus on how you\u2019d like your customers to feel after getting your message. Is it empowered, excited or curious, for example?\nHave fun. The more excited you feel while writing, the more excited your customers will be to learn and progress.\nCongratulate your customers when they hit important milestones or even when they achieve smaller tasks. This will make them feel smart, capable and appreciated.\nKeep it personal. Intercom makes it easy to personalize each message so that it's customized to everyone who gets it. For example, you can include\ncustom attributes\nin your message, so that the content is specific to each user.\nPro tip:\nFor more tips on this, check out our\nstaying personal at scale guide\n.\nMeasure the effectiveness of your messages\nWe strongly recommend keeping a close eye on how your messages are doing and iterating based on the results.

All A/B tests should start with a question; i.e., 'will A or B be better at achieving X?'.\nHere are some examples:\nWhich content layout will result in more replies?\nWhich content will result in more users upgrading?\nWhich content layout will help me capture more visitor emails?\nWhich subject line will get more users to open my email?\nWill a button generate more click-throughs than a text link?\nThere's lots more to why you should A/B test. We wrote a\nblog post all about it here\n.\nTest, test, and test again\nYou should always be testing, and learning. For example, if you test a button against a link, and the button wins, next you should be testing the button colour. Then when you have a winner from that, test the button copy. The key point is that the more you test, the more effective your messages will become. Always be testing.\nHow to set up your A/B test\nFirst, go to\nOutbound\nfrom the main menu and click\n+\nNew message\nin the top right corner.\nBefore putting it live, make sure that you have at least:\nGiven your message a name\nSelected your audience.\nSelected your channel.\nAdded the content of your message. This message will be message \"A\" in your test.\nNote:\nYou can start an A/B test against a message that's already live. It doesn't have to be when you create your message for the first time.\nNow, start your A/B test\nOnce you have your message A set up, click 'Run a new test' and choose the option for A/B test.\nThis will create a draft of your B message. Initially, this is just a duplicate of your existing message. You can now edit the duplicate with whatever it is you're going to test (e.g., different subject lines, different text, different button colours, or different images, whatever you want). You can even have the two messages appear from different teammates!\nWhat can be A/B tested?\nYou can A/B test anything that lives within the Content creation step of the message:\n\u200b\nBest practice\nWe recommend that you only compare one difference at a time. This way, if there is a clear winner, you'll know the reason, and you won't be left guessing about which variant caused the difference.\nFinally, put it live\nOnce you're happy with the two messages, put them live.\nMonitor progress\nYou can check the performance on the auto message list page, or on the message page. On the message page just toggle between version A and version B to see the stats for each. As time goes by, you'll be able to see which variant is performing better in the metrics you care about most. For example, if you were A/B testing subject lines, you would be likely concerned with open rates.\nChoose a winner once you have a result\nOnce you're happy that one message is outperforming the other (for example when one message's goal % is higher than the other) select the 'Pause' button on the message you'd like to stop. 100% of recipients will now get the winning message. This will automatically pause the other message and people will no longer receive it (unless you decide to put it live again).\nFAQs\nHow does this work with A/B messages within a Series?\nWhen a user enters a Series and matches for a message that has a A/B test, it will be random as to what variant they receive. If multiple messages within a Series are being A/B tested, this means that a user can get a mixture of As or Bs.\nIf you wish to A/B test a sequence of messages within their Series, you can use the\nsplit test feature\nif it's part of your subscription. If you do not have access to this feature, a workaround is to set up two different Series and split the Series audience in half.\nWhat happens if I make a small changes to version A or B after going live? Will we reset the stats for that version?\nWhat happens if I make a small changes to version A or B after going live? Will we reset the stats for that version?\nMaking changes to a version after the message has gone live means that you could skew your results.\nAny changes to a message variant will not reset the stats for that version. If you wish for the stats to reset, you would need to delete that version and create a new version (and be aware that you will not have a record of the previous version stats so you may want to export your results first)\nIf I set a message live and then create a version B after, what will happen to the message stats?\nThe message stats for version A will be all of the sent messages to that date, and version B will start from scratch.\nSetting a version B late after the message has been set live means that you will not get a true 50/50 split, and might not be able to pick a clear winner.\nIs it possible to set the A/B test live, but have the audience do to a small set of users at first before picking a winner?\nBoth versions of the message are sent out concurrently. We do not send to a portion of the audience, wait for a message to be a 'winner', and send all remaining matches to that version.\nA workaround would be to tag a portion of users and have the tag in the audience rules when setting the message live. After it has been sent to the smaller audience, You can remove the tag from the rules and have only the A or B go to the rest of the audience.\nWhy do I not see an equal 50/50 split in the sent statistic?\nThere are a few things to check here:\n\u200b\n1: Check if one of the versions was set live long before the second version (therefore the majority of sends will be from the first version).\n2: Check if the message uses company data in it's content - since all users from a company are expected to get the same version in this scenario, then the split may be skewed depending on the amount of users in the company.\n\u200b\n3: If the audience of the message is quite small, then the split might not appear as 50/50. The size of the split is down to probability. The bigger the audience of the message gets, the more likely the audience of both variations will even out.\nIs it possible to do an a/b test where half the audience gets the message, and half the audience gets not message?\nYes, you can do this with a\ncontrol group\n.\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow do I export outbound message data?\nProve the impact of your messages with control groups\nKeep track of message changes and performance\nTest different paths with multivariate split testing in Series\nA/B test your survey"},

If you find yourself with too many tasks, spread them across multiple checklists.\nThe more intent a customer has the more tasks you can get away with having, i.e. a customer who chooses to take a checklist is more likely to complete\nFYI customers only see the first 4-5 tasks before they have to scroll to reveal the rest \ud83d\udc47\nSave space at the top\nYou can see below two checklist examples, the one on the left only has a title.\nWhile the other shows a title, description and the sender.\nThe description and whether to show the sender are optional settings which you can choose not to use. If you only use a title you'll notice 5 tasks are now visible before the customer has to scroll to see more.\nExperiment with these options and decide whether adding a sender or showing a description adds value to your checklist. This may depend on your brand and tone of voice, or the situation you're using the checklist in. If the description isn't adding vital information that you can't fit in the title or explain in the tasks, then you could decide to leave it blank.\nSet realistic completion times\nUnderestimating the time to complete will frustrate customers and lead to disengagement.\nThis makes setting the right expectations even more important.\nSo, how can you figure out how long a checklist actually takes to complete?\nA good way is to take the average time from a number of completions, for example you could:\nPretend you are a user and take the checklist multiple times (don't forget to act like them, no speeding)\nShare the checklist with colleagues and ask them to time themselves\nTest the checklist on a small set of users and survey them about their experience\nIf you're estimated time is realistic but still feels a bit too long, consider spreading the tasks over two checklists instead.\nMake your checklists easy to read\nDue to the limited space available in your checklist, every word matters.\nLet's take a look.\nChecklist titles\nKeep these simple and brief, use attributes to personalize if it makes sense.\nChecklist descriptions\nThese are optional, so if you're struggling to write copy that adds value you can just leave it blank. In the example above you'll note that the description just repeats the title without adding any new or useful information.\nTask titles\nConcise understandable titles are key to a good checklist. You should always try to start these with a verb. This keeps the sentence active instead of passive and makes them more interesting to read.\nYou should also try to use the same sentence structure and length for each of your steps. Using similar structures makes the checklist easier to read and understand.\nSee this in action below.\nGood example:\nEach task starts with a strong and clear verb.\nThey are all short and to the point, with no extra words.\nBad example:\n'Setting' is in the present tense for no reason.\nThe second step is phrased as a question, which is different to all the rest.\n'It's time to' is unnecessary.\nThe last step is okay, but 'Let' is a more passive way than starting with 'Share'.\nTask descriptions\nYour descriptions should add any clarifying detail that couldn't fit in the title. It's best when these are kept short, so don't be afraid to\nhyperlink\nto other content in here if needed.\nCall to action text\nButtons in your checklist should be very specific and also start with a verb, keep them short and simple.

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/230-our-best-practice-guide-for-staying-personal-at-scale", "title": "Our best practice guide for staying personal at scale", "content": "Impersonal messages are perfect if you want the recipient to do nothing. But what if you want your recipient to read more, click a button, watch a video, download a file, trust you, believe you, or have a relationship with you? You need to be friendly, natural, and timely. Put simply, you need to be personal. It's a powerful tactic to employ when engaging customers at scale. Customer engagement at scale leads to mass customer retention, which directly impacts the growth of your business, so it is critical you get this right.\nThe problem is that when you start messaging hundreds or thousands of your customers all at once, you run the risk of suddenly being not very personal at all. One-size-fits-all messages are the least personal kind of message you can send. And as soon as you send one, it will end up in the dreaded \"promotions inbox\" with the rest of the equally non-attention grabbing messages the person got that day. Chances are it will be archived or ignored entirely.\nAt Intercom, we\u2019re fully aware of these issues. So we built features designed specifically to let you stay personal when communicating with your customers at scale.\nCustomize each message\nWhen your customers open your message and it begins with \u201cDear Sir/Madam\u201d, they\u2019re already losing interest. But why should they be interested? They can easily tell from the content of messages like this that it's not written specifically for them. You need to personalize each message so that it's customized to everyone who gets it.\nIt's easy to automatically include each customer\u2019s first name, last name, company names and a whole ton of other info specific to their profile.\nRead more about personalizing message with variables here\n.\nYou can also include custom data values specific to each user. For example, you can tell customers the number of projects they\u2019ve created, how much they owe you, when their last report was shared, what their most played songs were, or any other custom data value you can think of. Piquing your customers\u2019 interest with information specific to them is a sure way to get them interested in your message. Check out\nthis blog post\non how we used customer data to proactively reach out to our customers and solve a real problem they were having.\nUse a message style appropriate for personal communication\nOver-designed mass marketing messages and generic, impersonal notifications don\u2019t get our attention. It\u2019s because as soon as we see a message that isn\u2019t written specifically for us, we afford it less importance. Experience has taught us that generic content is rarely as important or relevant as a personal note from someone. With this in mind, we strongly recommend you cut back on the imagery, the full screen takeovers, the animated gifs and the beautifully styled content with headers, bullets and all the slick formatting and grammar.\nYou don\u2019t spend hours designing and formatting your message for a friend when all you want to do is have a personal chat - so why do it when talking to your customers? Just use short-hand writing in your messages and\nuse a message style\nappropriate for having a conversation. They will feel more like a one-to-one communication. You\u2019ll see engagement rates go up as a result.\nStay relevant. Stay timely.\nYour message isn't personal if it isn\u2019t relevant. It\u2019s our old mantra from way back when we started Intercom in 2011: \u201cThe right message. The right way. At the right time\u201d. It's simple to get this right:\nDon't message your customers about your new pro features if they\u2019re already on your pro plan.\nDon\u2019t ask new users for feedback about a feature if they\u2019ve only just signed up today and haven\u2019t even used it yet.\nDont message customers who have quit to ask them how things are going.\nRather, you should message your customers based on who they are, and what actions they do or don\u2019t take in your product. You do this by triggering messages through a combination of\nuser attributes\n(to send messages to the right people) and\nuser events\n(to send messages at the right time). For example, if you wanted to target a specific group of users to ask them for feedback on your latest pro feature, you might set the filters on your message so that it only went to people who have access to the feature, who have only recently upgraded to your pro plan, who are paying you more than $50/mo, and who have just recently used the feature for the 5th time. You\u2019ll get higher engagement rates and better quality responses because the message is relevant and personal to these users. It's entirely irrelevant to customers on your free plan who have never used it.\nUse a real photo of your face\nMake sure to\nupload\na smiley happy avatar in your Intercom settings. Not your company logo. Not your team group photo. Not your dog\u2019s profile shot. Use a smiling happy photograph of your face. It really does help. It lets your customers know there is a human at the other end of this conversation. Your customers will trust you more because of it.\nInvite more conversation\nAlways end your messages by inviting your customers to ask questions and continue the conversation. By inviting more conversation you\u2019re showing them that you\u2019re available and open to a one-to-one interaction. Thats personal.\nBe available and quick to reply\nYou can be as personal as you like in your initial message, and invite conversation from your customers, but if you\u2019re not quick to follow up with any questions they have, you\u2019ve blown it. Thats not personal. Intercom\u2019s\ndesktop and mobile notifications\nfor admins let you know as soon as you receive replies so that you can jump in and continue the conversation with your customer there and then.\nManage expectations when you can\u2019t reply\nIf your customer is expecting a reply, but they don\u2019t get one, it's not a very nice experience for them. But obviously, you\u2019re not always going to be available to reply - so we\u2019ve worked hard to build features that manage your users\u2019\nexpectations\nabout when they will get a reply. If they\u2019re not going to get one any time soon, let them know when they should expect one; it's a way better experience.\nAutomatically route messages to the right place\nTriaging a busy inbox and assigning messages to the right people takes time and effort. And this means more time your customers are waiting for a reply. Intercom lets you automatically assign replies to particular messages to the correct people and team. You can also designate a particular person or team to receive all new inbound queries. This means that your customers are likely to get a quicker response, from the right person.\nYou can also\nautomatically assign conversations using Workflows\nso that all inbound messages go to a particular person or team. For example you could create a workflow so that messages from different incoming email addresses go to the right team. This way your\nsupport@company.com\nemails can go to the support team, and\nsales@company.com\ncan go to the sales team. Or you can automatically assign messages based on what language they\u2019re written in, or what keywords the message contain.\nDo things that don\u2019t scale\nIt's a clich\u00e9 because it works. Do things that don\u2019t scale. Things like sending personal video welcome messages, or one-off handwritten notes do not scale easily, unless you have a team of people dedicated to doing them, but they have great impact. Set some time aside each week and reach out to some customers on an individual, one-to-one basis. It's worth it.\nStay automated. Stay personal.\nWe\u2019re not in the business of disguising automated mass messages as one-off one-to-one messages. And you shouldn\u2019t be either. But we are in the business of sending personal messages to customers at scale. There's a big difference. Follow the above advice and you can stay personal while staying automated.\nWhat's next?\nYou can find out more about\nhow to give personal support in our previous webinar - Manage and Scale your Support\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nOrganize team inboxes\nOur best practice guide to customer support\nEmail marketing best practices\nBest practices for using Product Tours\nCustomize Fin AI Agent's personality"},

You\u2019ll want to set these up first and then create News Items specifically for them.\nTo get started, go to\nSettings  > Outbound > Newsfeeds\n. Here, you\u2019ll be able to manage and create\nTargeted Newsfeeds\nfor specific audiences.\nUsers/Visitors will receive the Newsfeed that is targeted for them and that is top of the order of the feed priority.\nAdd a Newsfeed by clicking on\n+ Create Newsfeed\n:\nGive the Newsfeed a title to describe which audience this is for:\nThen define the audience by selecting from Users, Leads and/or Visitors. If you want to create a very targeted audience click\nAdd audience rule\nand use attributes to define this audience.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished selecting the audience and adding any audience rules, click\nSave and close\n.\nThe figure for \u2018the number of people in your audience right now\u2019 indicates the maximum total reach and shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as total potential reach. Some of those people may be captured in another Newsfeed of higher priority and see that Newsfeed instead.\nAfter creating a Newsfeed, take note of the order in which the Newsfeeds appear. This is the order in which customers will be matched to a specific Newsfeed. Once matched, customers will be able to see News Items assigned to that Newsfeed only.\nYou can re-order the Newsfeeds by dragging them to the top or bottom of the list.\nAudience rules for Newsfeeds only apply to accessing News Items in the Messenger. News Item can be directly accessed by URL, even if the contact doesn't match the associated News Feed. This allows you to share the URL to a News Item with people  outside the News Feed audience (e.g. send as a link in a promotional email).\nUse your News Center\nGet the most out of News by turning your News Center on. The News Center is a live webpage where your News can be accessed and shared from.\nTo turn your News Center on, go to\nSettings  > Outbound > Newsfeeds\nand click on\nNews Center Settings\nat the top. Then select\nTurn on News Center.\nYou don\u2019t need to turn on the News Center if you only want your News to display in the Messenger.\nWhen you turn on your News Center, your content is available through\nintercom.news\nby default. Your URL will look like this:\nintercom.news/exampleapp\n. If you\u2019d like to use a different URL, you can create one by\nsetting up a custom domain\n.\nCustom domains for News Center aren't supported for\nAU/EU hosted workspaces\n.\nCustomize your News Center by:\nDefining the URLs and setting up analytics tracking.\nStylizing with your logo, header image and color, as well as links to your social channels.\nWhen you add News Items to your News Center they\u2019ll be displayed on that dedicated webpage URL.\nImportant:\nPublished News Items which are added to your News Center will be listed on search engines. This can be turned off in your\nNews Center settings\n.\nThe News Center is currently only supported in English. Therefore it will not reflect the default language of your Messenger.\nCreate a News Item\nFirst, go to\nOutbound\nfrom the main menu and click\n+\nNew message\nin the top right corner.\nThen, choose\nNews item\nas your content type.\nYou can also choose to start with a pre-made template by picking this\ncontent type\nfrom the left sidebar.\nUpload a feature image for your News Item which will display in the Newsfeed when you share it.\nImage size 900x504px is recommended for a News Item. This can be a JPEG, JPG or PNG file.\nGive the News Item a title and add your content in the News editor. You can add copy and use attributes, images, tables, buttons, dividers, videos, files, HTML code, emojis, bulleted lists, and numbered lists or stylize your copy - all the content elements that you\u2019re familiar with when creating content blocks.\nIn this example, we\u2019ve added a link to more info and used emojis:\nWhen you\u2019ve finished creating the content, decide which teammate the announcement will be from by selecting the\nSender\n:\nAssign your News Item to the relevant Newsfeeds. This is how you\u2019ll target a specific audience and only show News that's relevant to each customer.\nYou can select one or multiple Newsfeeds which you have previously set up.\nSee how to create a Newsfeed here\n.\nAdd one or more\nLabels\nto the News Item:\nSelect up to 3 labels for them to be fully displayed in the Messenger.\nEncourage customers to express their reactions to your news by enabling the\nReaction\nreply type:\nDraw more attention to your news announcement by adding a badge on the Messenger Launcher when your news is shared:\nThe red badge will only show if a customer has visited your Newsfeed before. This means they'll have seen any previous News Items you've shared and will be alerted by the badge when there is something new for them to see.\nThen decide whether you want to add this News Item to your News Center. This will make it available on a live URL that you can share in other places such as email and social.\nYou\u2019ll need to turn your News Center on first.\nFind out how to enable the News Center and customize it to suit your brand\n.\nAfter creating your News Item, finish up by scheduling when this News can start or stop showing in the Messenger.\nNow you\u2019re ready to set your News Item live and share your news! \ud83c\udf89\nCheck News Items performance\nAccess detailed reporting for your News Items by clicking the Opened, Clicked, or Reacted tabs next to the Overview.\nReporting on Newsfeeds is not available.\nCreate News Items via the Public API\nYou can also share News Items via the unstable public API.

This flexibility, combined with nuanced targeting based on your customer data makes for the ultimate contextual messaging experience.\nThe visual builder makes it a breeze to orchestrate even the most dynamic messaging journeys.\nWhat is a Series?\nA Series is made up of \u2018blocks\u2019.\nThere are four kinds of block:\nA rule block\nis where you define the filters that a customer must meet to enter a series, or proceed down a specific path.\nYou can filter based on customer/company data attributes, or interactions with previous parts of a series.\nA content block\nis where you create the content that your customers should receive. You can send:\nChats & Posts\n,\nProduct Tours\n,\nMobile Carousels\n,\nEmails\n,\nMobile Push messages\n,\nCustom Bots\n, or\nBanners\n.\nEach content block can have a goal, and specific scheduling.\nA wait block\nlets you define a specific time period, or date that must pass before customers will proceed any further through a series.\nA tag block\nlets you automatically apply tags to customers as they complete their journey through a series. You can tag customers when they match the filters for a rule block, or based on interactions with series content.\nTags can then be used to enter or exit customers from other series,\nfilter your reports\n,\ndefine segments\nor\nbuild custom Help Desk views\n.\nBlocks are connected in paths.\nYou can have a simple linear path like: Entry rule for Non-premium users - Intro Post message - Has clicked a link in the 'Intro Post' rule - Feature Tour\nMultiple separate paths like: Entry rule for Non-premium users - Intro Post message - Wait for 3 days - Feature Tour or Entry rule for Premium users - Intro Chat message - Has replied to the 'Intro Chat' message - Tag Replied to intro\nOr, paths that diverge and converge as needed:\nThis means it\u2019s easy for customers to enter the series for different reasons, get relevant and contextual messages, and exit at the right time. \ud83d\udc4c\nHow to build a Series\nFirst, go to\nOutbound > Series\nand from the main menu and click\n+\nNew Series\nin the top right corner.\nYou can choose to start from scratch, or get started quickly with a pre-made template.\nFor this example, we\u2019ll start from scratch. The first step to take is adding the entry rules. This is the set of filters a customer must match to enter the series and start receiving messages. Just drag and drop a rule block from the sidebar on the right:\nIf you\u2019d like certain types of customers to enter the same Series at different paths, just create multiple rule blocks. \ud83d\udc4c\nThen click on the rule block to open its settings. Here you can choose the\nfilters\na customer must match to enter the Series:\nCustomers can re-enter the same Series multiple times if you\nenable \"Re-enter Series\" on the starting rules block\n. This is useful when you\u2019ve got a set of messages you want to send to customers when a recurring event happens such as a subscription expiring, or a purchase being made.\nIn this example, we\u2019re targeting all users who don\u2019t yet have the \u2018Premium\u2019 plan, so we can encourage them to upgrade.\nAs you add blocks, it\u2019s a good idea to give them a clear title, which will be visible in the Series overview, so you can see at a glance what\u2019s going on like Non-premium users for Entry Rules:\nNext, let\u2019s add our first piece of content; a post message sent in your app. You can drag and drop a message block from the right hand menu, or just hover over the previous block and add it like this:\nThen, open the message to create its content:\nYou can also\nset an individual\ngoal\nfor this message, and\nschedule\nit to send at exactly the right time:\nFor each message block, you can define how long a message should\ntry\nto send for, as your customers might not be online to receive it right away. By allowing them a little more time to log in and receive it, your messages can be sent in exactly the right order.\nClick this section to set the time period you\u2019d like to attempt to send the message for. After this period, anyone who hasn\u2019t come online to receive the message will be\ndisengaged\nwith this path in the Series:\nOr, you can create a path for anyone who doesn\u2019t receive it in the specified time period:\nTry a different channel if sending additional messages to customers who haven\u2019t logged in. For this example, we\u2019ll add an email message as a fallback:\nFor all the users who\ndo\nreceive the message, you can add specific rules based on how they interacted with it. E.g. you could target everyone who clicks the upgrade link in the message. Just hover over \u201cWhen delivered\u201d for all the options:\nSelect the behaviour you want to target (in this example \u2018Clicked link\u2019) and it\u2019ll automatically add a rule block:\nThis allows you to direct users down separate paths based on whether or not they match the rule. You can also define exactly how long they have to interact with the previous message by editing the\nTry to match\nrule.\nWhen it comes to matching times on Rule blocks within a Series:\n\u200b\ufeff\n\"\nTry to match for x time\n\" means it will wait\nup to that amount of time\nfor the person to match the rule. If they match sooner, they'll move on sooner. If they don't match in that time, they will either progress down an \"if not matched\" path (if you have one set up) or disengage from the path (if none are set up).\n\u200b\ufeff\n\"\nTry to match once\n\" means that if the person does not match the rules\nas soon as they reach that node\nthey will leave the path or progress down an \"if not matched\" path.\nThis rule doesn't allow any buffer time for users to take action and is typically better for scenarios where you won't need to wait for the user to do something (open or click on a message, take an action in your product, wait for an attribute to update, etc.). This rule is designed to immediately move them onto another message or part of the path.\nIn this case, they have three days to click the link after receiving the email:\nLet\u2019s do the same for the fallback email, so we can capture everyone who engages with the offer, and direct them to the same next step:\nIn this case the next step will be a product tour, to demonstrate all the value the customer can get out of the \u2018Premium\u2019 plan. To connect one block to another, just drag and drop the connecting arrow:\nSeries lets you automate more than just messaging, so let\u2019s automatically tag everyone who upgrades their plan after progressing through this Series. To do so, we need one more rule block which targets any customer who received the Product Tour, and is now on the \u2018Premium\u2019 plan:\nThen, add a tag block:\nAnd, for those that haven\u2019t yet upgraded, we\u2019ll add one more email as a fallback, and link that to the same tag block if it causes an upgrade:\nNow, let\u2019s take a step back and look at this Series in its entirety.\nTo encourage customers to upgrade their plan, there\u2019s a Post message sent in your app, followed up with an email, both of which direct to a Product Tour. After customers take the tour, if they upgrade their plan they\u2019re tagged automatically. If not, they\u2019ll receive one last email to try again.\nThis example is based on the \u201cEncourage Customer Upgrades\u201d template. If you\u2019d like to explore a ready made version, just open that template and dive in. \ud83d\udc47\nUsing Events as a Trigger in Rule Blocks\nIt is important to note that when you create a rule block, the try to match rules only apply to the user matching the audience rules and not the triggers you have set.\nIf for example, you have a rule block with an event and 'try to match once', the user matches the audience rules but they will have to wait at this block until they trigger the event:\n\u200b\nWe will expire the user if they don't trigger the event within 30 days of reaching the block. At this time, they will go down the \"did not match\" pathway or disengage.\nIf you wish the user to progress in the Series if they have already triggered the event in the past, you should add the event as an audience rule instead:\n\u200b\nIf you only wish them to progress if they triggered the event very recently, you can use the rule \"event last occurred less than X days ago\".\nWait blocks\nThe \u201cWait\u2019 block enables you to add spacing between 2 messages.\nExample: Send an email \u2192 Wait for 3 days \u2192 Send a follow up chat message\nYou can set two conditions to trigger the next message:\n\u201cWait until a period of time\u201d\n\u201cWait until specific date\u201d\nWe check every 30 minutes for each internal rule, message, wait or tag block if a user matches.\nImplicit and explicit waiting\nFor each message block, you can define how long a message should try to send for, as your customers might not be online to receive it right away. Or, you can create a path for anyone who doesn\u2019t receive it in the specified time period.\nFor users who have interacted with your message you can add specific rules based on how they interacted with your message (eg: completed the bot flow) and then target the users who match that rule with a new message.\nFor these rule blocks you can define a time period the Series will check to see if a user matches the rule. Or you set it to try and match once (without setting a time period):\nIf there\u2019s a fallback path in place for customers who don\u2019t match a rule block, or receive a message, they\u2019ll proceed down this path instead, and not be marked as disengaged.\nDifference between\nimplicit/explicit\nwaiting: The wait times on a rules block allow you to define how long you want to try match the rules for. This is useful for cases where the user may not immediately take an action (e.g. If the user opens the last email). You want to allow time for the action to occur, and progress immediately when it does occur. This would not be possible with a simple wait block. Similarly, for in-app type messages, a wait block wouldn\u2019t allow you to say \u201cwait for the user to come online\u201d. This is what the wait on the message block is for.\nTag blocks\nTeammates will be able to use the tag block to tag or untag (remove tags) any users in Series, based on the actions they take:\nMultiple tags are allowed in the tag block.\nYou won\u2019t be able to create a new tag here, but can use any existing tag from the workspace.\nTag blocks can be used for example for:\nAutomatically include/excluding users in other Series\nTo update how customers are routed to your teams' inboxes\nTo flag to your team what messages customers have received / actions they\u2019ve taken\nTo remove tags from users based on what path they took in the Series\nAny tag can be removed with the untag option from the user, not just tags applied during the Series.\nTags can then also be used to enter or exit customers from other Series,\nfilter your reports\n,\ndefine segments\nor\nbuild custom Help Desk views\n.\nWe check every 30 minutes for each internal rule, message, wait or tag block if a user matches.\nDefine a goal for your Series\nTo properly gauge how effectively your Series is encouraging customer action, you should add a goal for anyone who enters. Do this under \u2018Show settings\u2019:\nThen choose the right filters and how long a customer has to meet the goal:\nIf a customer matches the filters for your goal\nafter\nthe set time period, they won\u2019t be counted towards the goal stats for this Series.\nFind more information about\nSeries goals\n.\nSet up your exit rules\nOn the same tab you can define overall exit rules for your series:\nIf a customer\u2019s data is updated to match the filters in this rule they will exit the series completely, and cannot re-enter.\nFor a simple way to manually remove specific customers from a series, just add an exit filter for all customers with a certain tag, then you can apply it as needed to anyone who should exit the series.\nCustomers can also exit a Series if they reach the end of a path, hit the series goal or don\u2019t engage with messages for a set time.\nRead more about when customers enter and exit a series in this article\n.\nSet your Series live\nWith your messages, entry rules, exit rules, and a goal in place it\u2019s time to set your Series live \ud83d\ude80\nIf there are any missing connections, or issues with your Series, you\u2019ll be warned before setting it live \ud83d\udc4c\nAs soon as you set the Series live, customers will start to enter if they match your entry rules, and you can easily measure how they\u2019re progressing:\n\"Scheduling\" is available for Series rather than \"Frequency and scheduling\" because a customer will only enter a Series based on entry or exit rules, so having a frequency is not applicable.\nTo learn all about measuring the performance of your Series,\nread this article.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCopying messages, tours, carousels and bots into Series\nMeasure how well your series performs\nSeries best practices, tips & examples\nView a Series Performance Summary Report\nSeries FAQs"},

The message will not count as sent until the User is online to see it.\nOpened\nMessages sent in full are marked as opened as soon as they are displayed to the user.\nYour opened rates for posts and notes sent in full, should typically be above 90%, and often above 95%. At Intercom, our average opened rate for announcements is 98%.\nNote:\nIf customers have any previously unread messages, these messages will not show in full, instead they will appear as a snippet until the user clicks on the message.\nMessages sent as a snippet are marked as \u201copened\" once the user clicks on the message to open it. So the message shown below has not been \u201copened\" yet by the user as it's still in the truncated preview state. This is why some chat messages can sometimes have very different opened rates VS sent rates.\nAnother reason for opened rates to be lower than expected is if a user navigates away from a page in the short gap between when the message is sent to them and when it is automatically displayed. This gap is typically in the order of seconds. This is pretty rare.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nIf an end-user receives a post in January and doesn't open till February, it won't show in Opened stats for February but will show for January instead.\nGoal\nWhen creating an auto message, you can\nset a goal\nto measure its effectiveness. You can see each user that matched the goal after receiving the message. Goal stats are based on messages sent.\nReplied\nReply rate is simply the number of people who replied to the message. This figure is based on how many messages were sent, not on how many were opened.\nClicked\nAs soon as a link or button (that automatically redirects through Intercom) inside the message has been interacted with it gets marked as clicked. Clicks in embedded videos won't get marked as clicked. This figure is based on how many messages were sent, not on how many were opened.\nImportant:\nClicking on an in-app chat to expand it doesn't count as a click.\nClicking on a video's play button doesn't count as a click.\nClicking on unsubscribe links don't count as clicks (you'll find these under the \"Failed > Unsubscribed\" statistic).\nClicks on\napps in messages\naren't counted as clicks.\nFor Visitor ongoing messages, because we can\u2019t provide a list of the people who received, opened, and clicked on a message, we only provide the links clicked breakdown.\nHow many \"Other\" links will show in the stats?\nEach user can only trigger an \"Other\" link once. For example, if an email template has 3 links, then regardless of how many of these links the user clicks, it will only count as 1 \"Other\" link.\nClicked no links from email template = \"Other\" links clicked 0 times\nClicked 1 out of 3 links from email template = \"Other\" links clicked 1 time\nClicked 3 out of 3 links from email template = \"Other\" links clicked 1 time\nIs it possible to pull out the unique links that are included in email templates?\nNo, if you add buttons/links in an email template, we will still track the clicks from users but they will all fall under the \"Other\" category.\nCan I store full URLs in custom data attributes?\nYes, but if you try to use that particular CDA in the message, we will not be able to determine what the link is. For example, the CDA called website_url where you store the user's unique website link, and you use that CDA as a placeholder in the message (e.g. {{website_url | fallback:\"\nwww.example.com\n\"}} ). Since we can only tell that this is a URL at the rendering/delivery stage, we cannot track it as a unique link. We will still track the clicks from users but they will all fall under the \"Other\" category.\nWhy does clicked stat show 0% on subsequent days?\nThe \"Clicked\" percentage chart displays the clicks over time, but the actual day it falls under is the day the user *received* the message, not the day they clicked. So if a user receives a message on Oct 11th and clicks on Oct 13th, the click will show under Oct 11th. This means for *fixed messages* (especially emails) that only send once, it's likely that all of the clicks will relate to the first day - the day it sent - which might be why there's a 0% click rate on subsequent days.\nIs it possible to trigger click events with relative URLs?\nExample, instead of putting in a URL, can I trigger click events by just using an part of the link as the URL? No! It is not possible for us to do click tracking without the\nhttp\n/\nhttps\npart of the link. In most cases, we will add the http:// for you, however if it is a URL that starts with\n/\nwe do not put the http protocol in front (as there is no way that we can determine what the domain will be), and we therefore cannot track the click through\nvia\n.\nIf I have a message with multiple buttons/links in it, can I find out which button/link they clicked?\nYes, so long as the customer has\nclick tracking\nenabled. If so, the details can be seen in the Message statistics.\nWhat if I have added two links with the exact same URL (e.g. one button at the top of the message, and one button at the bottom, but both buttons have the exact same URL)?\nWe are not able to distinguish these as two different links. Clicks for either of the buttons will be recorded under the one URL. The only exception for this is when there is 1 button and 1 hyperlinked image/text. We can then recognize that these are two separate links, with the same URL. The uniqueness of a link is determined by both the URL and the link type (button / hyperlinked image / hyperlinked text).\nDo we track click stats for Push Messages?\nNo, it is not possible to add a hyperlink into the body of a push message, and we cannot track if a user opens a push message + is redirected to a URL (as this is self contained in the mobile app, and does not get redirected through Intercom).\nAudience\nManual messages come with 'Audience' stats too. Your 'Audience' stats show you the number of people who match the rules for that message.\nReactions (Chats and Posts only)\nA list of users that interacted with the emoji Reactions set.\nManual messages with company data\nIf you have a user who belongs to multiple companies and you send them a manual message containing any company data, a variation of the message will be generated for each company that the user belongs to (because the message content will be slightly different). Each variation will be immediately marked as sent, but won't be \"opened\" until the user\nis signed into that company\n.\nLightweight replies\nDepending on which Intercom products you have, you might be sending messages with reactions. These are fun and expressive emojis you can choose as your reply type if you don\u2019t want to manage a ton of text replies. For these messages, you can click your \u2018Responded\u2019 stat and you\u2019ll see how many and which customers responded with each emoji.\nNote:\nMessage data is only kept for 2 years.\nEmail message stats explained\nEmail stats work largely the same as in-app messages.\nSent is the number of times the email was sent.\nOpened is the % or number of emails opened, based on the sent number.\nReplied and clicked work the same as with in-app messages in that they are based on the sent figure, not on the opened figure.\nFailed is the % of users an email has failed to deliver to. You can click the \u2018failed\u2019 stat to see which users bounced, who unsubscribed and marked the email as spam.\nTips to prevent your emails from failing:\nIf a lot of users have unsubscribed after receiving a particular email, you should\nreview your message content and re-write it to be more engaging\n.\nIf a lot of users have marked your email as spam, you should review your message schedule and ensure you\u2019re not sending too many messages. We recommend adding a \u2018last contacted at more than 2 days\u2019 ago filter to every message you send.\nOr if a lot of users are bouncing, you should clear your email list of old, disengaged users (for example, some users may have changed their email address). We explain bounce rates below.\nWhat is a bounce?\nA bounce is a message which has not delivered successfully. There are two types of bounces: hard bounces and soft bounces.\nA\nsoft bounced message\nis a temporary failure in delivery which can be caused by mailboxes being full or mail servers being offline.\nA\nhard bounced message\nis a permanent failure in delivery. For example, a message could hard bounce when:\nThe email address does not exist on a server.\nThe domain name doesn\u2019t exist.\nOr the recipient has blocked delivery.\nImportant:\nWhen you send a message we automatically remove addresses that hard bounce from your audience list for that message. And we don't attempt to send to those addresses again. We do this as continued attempts to deliver to invalid email addresses can harm Intercom's sending reputation.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nComposing an outbound message\nSegment out your active users for messaging\nHow do I export outbound message data?\nA/B test different message variations\nOutbound WhatsApp messages"},

This ensures users get a quick response, and no leads are left behind.\nWhen creating a message, just scroll down to the 'Frequency and scheduling' section. From here, choose whether to send your message during your office hours, outside of your office hours, or within a custom time set by you.\nWhere possible, we recommend scheduling your message to send during your\noffice hours\n.\nNote\n:\nIf you choose to start sending your message immediately, you'll still need to set it live first.\nDelivery times for emails and mobile push messages are calculated based on the recipient's timezone, to avoid any disruption at inconvenient hours.\nDelivery times for chat and post messages are calculated based on your\napp\u2019s timezone\n, to avoid delivering outside of business hours and setting false expectations for a \"real time\" response.\nThe message will not appear paused outside these times, but they will be inactive.\nScheduling a date and time for your message to go live\nIt's easy to schedule a time for your message to go live. Your message will begin sending at that time, assuming that customers match the other filters that you set. When creating a message, you will see the option to schedule a time for your message:\nNote that the time and date you set will be your app's timezone, not your customer's timezone. For example, imagine your app is set to Pacific time and your customer's timezone is New Zealand. In this case, when you schedule a message to send at 9am on Wednesday, it will send to your customer at 2pm on Tuesday.\nHow to send messages during specific times\nWhen creating a message, you will see the option to schedule a time for your message to go live in the 'Schedule your message' section.\nIn this section you can also select custom days and times that you want your message to be sent. Your automated email or push message will only send during those times, assuming\nall other filters you set are matched\n.\nFor example, you could set your email or push message to only send during weekdays and within business hours. You'll get better open and engagement rates during that window.\nNote:\nEvent based Messages will send when an Event is triggered regardless of scheduling.\nSo if a message is set to only send during custom times 10am to 5pm but the Event is triggered at 5am it will send \u2705.\nHow the custom time works\nYour email or push message will only send to users who match all filters during the custom time that you set.\nWhen possible the recipient's time zone will be used, but if a recipient's time zone is unknown the app's time zone will be used instead.\nNote:\nFor fixed messages, sending during custom times will only send to customers whose timezone overlaps with your app's timezone during the window it's open, for example:\nIf you set your message to send from 9am-12pm on Wednesdays only, that window will \"open\" at 9am in your app's timezone, then any customer who is between 9am-12pm in their timezone will receive the message.\nWhen the window \"closes\" at 12pm in your app's timezone\nno further customers will receive it\n.\nA customer who is 8 hours ahead of you won't receive the message at all, since there is no overlap during that 3 hour window.\nIf you have a global customer base, a better option might be to set it up as a\ndynamic message\nwith a stop date, so it sends to everyone over the course of 24 hours as their timezone matches the custom sending window.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nShare your expected response time\nWhy hasn\u2019t a user received my message?\nSet custom office hours and reply times for your teams\nSend messages on a recurring schedule\nCreating and sending SMS"},

Intercom makes it easy to create and send two versions of a message to see which is the most effective.\nSet up rules for outbound email\nFirst, decide if if you want your email to be triggered automatically and then target the right audience.\nTriggers\n- Allow you to automatically send repeatable messages based on when customers match event or date based rules.\nAudience\n- Allows you to choose who will receive the message either when an event or date based rule is matched, or as soon as you set your email live.\nUse triggers to send outbound email\nIf you want to send an ongoing email any time a customer matches the rules, use triggers to\nsend repeatable messages\nbased on events you track in Intercom.\nFor example, if you wanted to re-engage customers by sending an ongoing email any time a customer is inactive for more than 90 days, you could add a trigger for \"Last seen if it's 1 day after the date\" and then add an audience rule for \"Last seen more than 90 days ago\":\nTo use event or date triggers, the audience must be \"Dynamic\" and not \"Fixed\".\nAdd audience rules to an outbound email\nThe audience who receives this email can be:\nDynamic\n- people who match rules now and in the future (for sending an ongoing message), or\nFixed\n- only people who match rules right now (for sending a one-off message).\nLearn the difference between these audience types\n.\nChoose who should receive this email by clicking\n+ Add audience rule\n. The audience can be defined using\npeople and company data\nyou track through Intercom or by\nuploading a CSV file\nwith the customer data.\nFor example, you could send this to a \"Fixed\" audience of users \"Last seen more than 90 days ago\" and this will send only to users who matched this rule when the email was set live.\nYou can combine \"And / Or\" filters in your audience rules for very specific targeting. Select an audience\nsegment you've created\n, or use the\n+ icon\nto create a new filter group.\nFor example, you could send this email to users \"Last seen more than 90 days ago\"\nand\n\"Country is Ireland\" and this will send to all users who match\nboth\nrules when the email is set live.\nA filter group can be created using \"And\" / \"Or\" to combine data (not both). If you want this email to match users from different filter groups, simply click\n+ Add audience rule\nto make a new filter group. Then you can choose whether users must match\nboth\nfilter groups, or whether they can match\neither\nfilter group.\nFor example, you could send this email to users who match the rules in:\nGroup 1\n- \"Country is Ireland\" and \"First Seen less than 30 days ago\"\nor\nGroup 2\n- \"Country is United Kingdom\" and \"Tag is Beta users\"\nThis would send to all users who match\neither\nof these filter groups when the email is set live.\nThe audience preview for email messages won't look the same as when you're targeting the same users with a chat or a post message, or if you are filtering them in\nContacts\n.\nWith email messages, we automatically exclude users that:\nDon't have an email\nHave unsubscribed from you\nHave marked your emails as spam\nHave bounced any emails you've sent to them\nThe users that are excluded from receiving email messages can be found within your\nContacts\nby using the same filters in your message and then additionally adding\nEmail has any value\nand\nUnsubscribed from Emails is true\nor\nMarked email as spam is true\nor\nHas hard bounced is true\n.\nChoose frequency and scheduling of outbound email\nWhen you've finished setting up who will receive your message, you can choose to start sending the email as soon as you set it live, or on a custom date and time you decide.\nRead this article to find out more about message scheduling.\nSet goal and UTM tracking for outbound email\nEvery message you send should have a goal, but open and click rates will only tell you so much.

You can use those events to\nfilter and segment your users\n,\ntrigger\nmessages to them\n, or\ntarget\nthe messages that they receive\n.\nTriggering and targeting your messages with events are very similar processes and can be used together. This article breaks down exactly what the differences are, so you can get the most out of your events.\nFor example if you have a video editing app, you may want to notify your customers when an upload has completed so they can share it with their teammates.

You can configure all of this under the \u201cRules\u201d tab. Choose:\nWhen the message should be sent\n.\n\u2014 This is used to configure\nevent based messaging\n. If your message is strictly audience targeted, ignore this section.\nWhere to send it\n.\n\u2014 For audience based messages you can set up URL or \u201ctime on page\u201d rules.\nIf it should be received\nby all your customers, or just a certain group of visitors, leads or users.\nAudience type:\nDynamic\nmessages are sent to everyone who matches the filters when it is set live, and anyone who matches them in future.\nFixed\nmessages will only be sent to people who match the filters when the message is set live.\nWhen\nTo send people a message more than once (after a specific event occurs, or they take a certain action) click \u201c+ Add event rule\u201d.

For these messages it\u2019s not necessary to select an event trigger.\nEvent based messaging is not currently supported with Emails, or Product Tours.\nWhere\nFor messages that are not triggered by events, this is where you define \"Where\" it should be sent.\nYou can target specific page URLs, set a delay or both.

First, let\u2019s look at goals.\nGoals\nEvery message you send has a goal. But open and click rates will only tell you so much. Goals are the true measure of a how message is performing. When creating an ongoing message, you can set a goal to measure its effectiveness. You can see each user that matched the goal after receiving the message.\nTo add a goal to an ongoing message, choose it from the dropdown under 'Set your goal'. Next, choose the result you want to measure. In the below example we set our goal as 'Web sessions is increased'. Each user who gets this message, who then comes back to the app, will contribute to this goal's total.\nYou should also set a limit on how long your customers' actions should be counted towards the goal. For this example, we'd like all customers who have additional web sessions within 3 days of receiving the message to be counted.\nWith a longer time limit you'll see a higher percentage of recipients hit the goal, but it's also more likely their actions have been impacted by other factors, including your other messages.\nYou can set a goal using any piece of data in Intercom, whether it's an event or a user attribute; it can be any desired outcome for the message. For example, your goal could be to see users upgrade to your pro plan, to increase their iOS sessions, to send more messages, or to upload an avatar.\nOnce the message is live, you can track your goals performance on the message stats bar.\nWhen setting up a date goal, it is only possible to choose \"has any value\".\nHow are goals calculated?\nGoals are calculated based on the number of messages sent.\nYou can easily filter your goal by after the number of messages sent, opened or clicked:\nYou can of course add goals to\none-off messages\ntoo. \ud83d\udc4c\nIf the user has already matched the goal before being sent the message, they will not contribute towards the goal percentage.\nWhen do we check Message goals?\nEvery time an update is made to a user (regardless of the update being made via ping / REST API / CSV import), we will enqueue a goals check.\nIf the update that was made includes a change to the specific goal attribute, then the goal can be triggered - however updates that do not specifically update that attribute, will not trigger the goal. This is because when we enqueue a goals check, we only check the difference (diff) that was created, and we do not check the full user profile.\n\u200b\nAs an example, if a user pings, we will enqueue a goal check, but the only thing we are checking is the update of their last_request_at, not the full user profile. If an attribute for a user is updated in the ping (e.g.\nfavourite fruit is orange\n), we will check the goal against the changes made to last_request_at + favourite_fruit, but not against any other attributes that are on the user's profile.\nThe reason that we do not check the full user profile every time we enqueue a goal check is that users could then start triggering goals based off of data from before they received the message.\nWhat's next?\nA/B test different message variations\n.\nProve the impact of your messages with control groups\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nMerge lead and user profiles\nMeasure the effectiveness of Product Tours with goals\nKeep track of message changes and performance\nMeasure series effectiveness with goals\nOutbound WhatsApp messages"},

So when you add images in the composer, they aren't resized to fit like with a default email template.

Just select the 'Edit HTML' option in the lower left corner of the email composer.\nAdding attributes to your messages is easy. Just select the icon that appears on the right of any content block, and select the standard attribute, the custom attribute, or the event attribute that you would like to include in your message.\nYou can even add attributes to your links. For example, if you wanted to link each user to their company settings page, and the URL was\nwww.yourappname/settings/\n, you can add to the URL from your list of attributes.\nYou can also add attributes to HTML blocks. To do this you must manually type the attribute syntax. Note: To include attributes with fallbacks within HTML attributes, e.g. href or src, please use single quotes for the fallback text as using double-quotes creates invalid HTML there\nTo create a new line within a content block, hit 'Return'.\nYou can create a new content block by hitting 'Return' twice.\nTo delete an image or a video, just highlight it and press backspace.\nTo delete a button delete all the text in it, and then press backspace once more.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCreating HTML emails\nCreate HTML email templates\nUnderstand your outbound message stats\nHow do I export outbound message data?\nOutbound WhatsApp messages"},

This is available for customers to sign upon request.\nWe cannot accept any alterations to our DPA, as we are not at the scale where we can enter into bespoke DPAs with customers. If you have specific questions on the DPA, please reach out to us via Messenger.\nBespoke DPAs with customers\nIntercom's policy is that we only contract on the basis of our GDPR DPA.\n\u200b\ufeff\n\ufeffThis established approach is based on sound legal and operational reasons and reflects common practice for SaaS suppliers.\n\u200b\ufeff\n\ufeffFrom a legal perspective, the EU GDPR requires a processor like Intercom to flow down to its sub-processors certain data protection obligations contained in its customer contracts. We have prepared our DPA for GDPR compliance and, as such, to contain obligations which can be flowed down to our sub-processors. Quite simply, we would not be able to meet the GDPR's flow down requirement if we enter into bespoke DPAs with customers. This is particularly the case in relation to large scale sub-processors, such as Amazon Web Services, where there is little to no flexibility to negotiate their standard terms.\n\u200b\ufeff\n\ufeffFrom an operational perspective, Intercom has tens of thousands of customers, and is a rapidly expanding business. We simply don't have the bandwidth or operational flexibility to enter into different DPAs with different terms for each and every customer. This would create overly burdensome commitments for Intercom and is not scalable. By using the Intercom GDPR DPA, we can better manage our data protection obligations and thereby focus our activities on processing personal data in a compliant manner and providing customers with a streamlined service.\n\u200b\ufeff\nWe are certified for International Data Transfers:\nTo comply with the GDPR\u2019s requirements for international data transfers, Intercom participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Get in touch through the messenger or by emailing\ndataprotection@intercom.io\n.\nCoordination with our Vendors\nWhere appropriate, we require all of our third-party vendors to enter into data processing agreements that ensure customer data will remain protected in accordance with the GDPR and our obligations to you.\nEncryption\nAll data sent to or from Intercom is encrypted in transit using 256 bit encryption. Our API and application endpoints are TLS/SSL only and score an \u201cA+\u201d rating on Qualys SSL Labs\u2018 tests. This means we only use strong cipher suites and have features such as HSTS and Perfect Forward Secrecy fully enabled. We also encrypt data at rest using an industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithm.\nOur security measures\nSecurity is a priority for us. We have regular external audits, pentests and bug bounties. We\u2019ve built a robust security framework, achieving International Compliance standards (SOC2, ISO27001, ISO27701, ISO27018, HIPAA and HDS) and reviewed our internal access design to ensure the right people have access to the right level of customer data. More details are available on our\nSecurity\npage.\nWe continue to help our customers and prospective customers be compliant. Some steps you can take are:\nGet familiar with the GDPR requirements and how they affect your company.\nMap out everywhere you process data and carry out a gap analysis.\nSee how you can leverage Intercom to help with your GDPR compliance. Our audit reports, pen tests and security docs are available to customers on request.\nLook at your product roadmap, think about privacy when you\u2019re planning.\nChat to your lawyer about what your company needs to do to.\nKeep an eye on the developing guidelines from the\nEuropean Data Protection Board.\nWe will also continue to monitor new and emerging guidance to determine whether we need to make any additional changes to our data practices as a result of the CJEU's ruling.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow to contact us with data queries\nHow Intercom tracks and stores data\nIntercom\u2019s inactive workspace deletion process\nAccessing security and compliance documents\nHow data is hosted and processed in Intercom"},

This article will walk you through the process of requesting to delete teammate data.\nRequest removal of your teammate data\nIn order to have your teammate data permanently removed from our databases, you\u2019ll first need to have your teammate record\nremoved\nfrom every workspace you are a part of. Any\nteammate with access\nto the Teammates page in the workspace settings can remove teammates.\nTo remove a teammate, follow these steps:\nNavigate to\nSettings > Workspace > Teammates\n.\nClick \u201cEdit\u201d next to the teammate\u2019s name.\nSelect \u201cRemove Teammate.\u201d\nWhen prompted, reassign the teammate\u2019s conversations to another person or leave them unassigned. Any future messages sent to the removed teammate\u2019s Intercom email will go to the Unassigned inbox.\nIf you have been added to multiple workspaces, you will need to have a teammate remove you from each workspace individually.\nNote\n:\nYou cannot remove yourself directly or edit your own permissions. Another teammate with the necessary permissions must perform these changes.\nIn test workspaces, permissions inherit settings from the main workspace, so changes to teammates\u2019 permissions in the main workspace will apply automatically.\nRemoval versus deletion, what\u2019s the difference?\nWhen a teammate removes another teammate from a workspace, that means that:\nThe removed teammate\u2019s permissions in the workspace are cancelled. - They will no longer be able to access the workspace.\nThe teammate won't show up in the teammate list anymore.\nMessages, conversations, articles and assignment rules are reassigned from removed teammate to a teammate of your choice.\nConversations/sent messages will remain unchanged.\nRemoved teammates can be reinstated by inviting them back using the same email.\nReassigning conversations is a mandatory step before removing a teammate to maintain customer communication.\nHowever, when you request to have a teammate record permanently deleted, that means that:\nAll references to the existing teammate will be removed from our databases once the deletion is fully processed.\nConversations and messages sent by that teammate will be unchanged.\nRequest permanent deletion of a teammate record\nIf you want your own teammate record to be deleted, make sure you are no longer included as a teammate on any workspace. Once your teammate record has been removed from all workspaces, your data will be automatically deleted within 30 days.\nIf you are requesting to permanently delete a different teammate\u2019s data (not your own), you will need to provide the email address and admin_ID value for that teammate. Make sure you have removed the teammate from your workspace first. Once this is done, reach out to our team at\nteam@intercom.com\n.\nHard deletion is permanent, however you can cancel a delete request within 7 days of asking us to delete the teammate. After 7 days the teammate is permanently removed.\nHow does deleting a teammate affect reporting metrics?\nKey points when a teammate is deleted:\nThe conversations remain in reports.\nMetrics for deleted teammates are removed from\nTeam inbox performance\nreporting.\nThe current assignee is updated on all of their assigned conversations.\nThe newly assigned teammate will have their metrics changed when using\nTeammate assigned\nas a filter.

You'll need to create a new workspace in your desired region and manually transfer your data and settings. This process can be an opportunity to clean up outdated data and refine your organizational setup.\nWhat type of data is included?\nRegional Data Hosting means that\nyour customer data\nwill not be transferred outside of your region, save for the limited exceptions identified in the\nRegional Data Hosting Addendum\n.

To truly lock down your data, you should ensure that you've prevented insecure updates to your attributes.\nWhen enforcement is on, updates to attributes via the Messenger are ignored unless their value is updated via a valid JWT. This ensures that only trusted, signed sources can change user data in Intercom.\nWe recommend you enable this toggle for any attribute you\u2019re sending in your JWT.\nGo to\nSettings > Data > People\nChoose the attribute you wish to lock down\nEnable the toggle to \u201cPrevent insecure updates via the Messenger\u201d\nThis attribute updates toggle does not prevent you from\ncollecting data directly from leads with a bot\n.

If you lock down an attribute, only values sent via a secure JWT (JSON web token) can update this value. This prevents unauthorised updates to user data, ensuring only updates that come from you are applied to the user's data.\nYou can check the status of your attribute in\nSettings > Data > People\n. To learn more about securing your Messenger with JWTs see\nour help article\n.\nDoes this apply to standard attributes too?\nYes. You must lock down all attributes, standard and custom from\nSettings > Data > People\n.\nWhat happens if my frontend sends data without a JWT after enforcement is enabled?\nThe data is ignored. Intercom will not apply updates unless the JWT is present and valid.\nCan I test JWT enforcement before turning it on in production?\nYes.

To do this, add any attributes to your payload and ensure that any insecure Messenger requests are blocked.\nIn the code example above, our payload signs the\nuser_id\nand\nemail\n. It also includes an expiry, which should also go into the payload.\nFor these attributes, we should now\ndisable insecure Messenger updates\nfor those attributes. This means that that can only updated via a valid JWT and never without.\nWe recommend you enable this toggle for any attribute you\u2019re sending in your JWT. You can look at your workspace\u2019s attributes under\nSettings > Data > People\nNote: This attribute updates toggle does not prevent you from\ncollecting data directly from leads with a bot\n. This data comes directly from the user.\nStep 2: Update your frontend snippet to send JWTs for users\nInstead of passing an\nHMAC signature\nfor IDV, pass the JWT in Messenger settings as\nintercom_user_jwt\nFor Web (JavaScript SDK)\n:\nwindow.Intercom(\"boot\", {\napi_base: \"https://api-iam.intercom.io\",\napp_id: \"<YOUR_APP_ID_HERE\",\nintercom_user_jwt: \"<YOUR_USER_JWT_HERE>\"\n};\nAs noted in the previous section above, we are now sending our data attributes within the JWT and they have been removed from the snippet.\nFor detailed instructions on how to generate JWTs for your workspace see\nour main help center article\nor\nvisit your security settings\n. For mobile instructions, please see our developer docs for\niOS\nand\nAndroid\n.\nTroubleshooting\nThere are verbose failure logs and a token debugger tools in\nyour security settings\nto help with moving to JWTs.\nFor more information see our installation guide\n.\nFAQs\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t migrate?\nIdentity Verification will continue working for now, but JWTs provide stronger security and better control.\nHow do I revoke a JWT session?\nYou can set a short expiry (exp) or rotate signing keys to invalidate old tokens.\nCan I use both Identity Verification and JWTs together?\nOnce JWT authentication is enabled for a platform,\nIdentity Verification is no longer needed\n.

This means the Messenger will not boot.\nSimilarly on mobile, you can see errors in your IDE noting that your integration has \"Failed Identity Verification check\".\nImportant:\nIf you enforce Identity Verification without resolving errors, your Messenger will not load properly on domains where you have installed the Messenger.\nMissing hashes\nIf you have an error about missing hashes, you have to ensure you are generating hashes for your users using the Identity Verification secret from your workspace settings and one of their identifiers (user_id or email). It should be included with every user request.\nSetting up Identity Verification will require technical changes to your Intercom Messenger installation and requires access to server side code most of the time. This can be performed by whoever set up your Intercom workspace originally.\nIf you generate the hash with the user_id, you\u2019ll need to send the related user_id in all requests.\nInvalid hashes\nIf you are sending a hash but Intercom says it\u2019s invalid there are a few things to check:\nAre you using the correct Identity Verification secret?\nEach platform (Web, iOS and Android) has a unique secret\nand you must use the one provided in your Intercom settings. Making up your own won't work.\nYou also cannot use your API key to create hashes, only the\nIdentity Verification secret\nfrom\nyour Security Settings\n.\nYour [TEST] workspace and production workspace must be configured separately as each has its own set of unique Identity Verification secrets.\nAre you sending the relevant user identifier along with the user hash?\nIf you just send the user hash the Identity Verification check will fail. You must also include the identifier that you hashed with the request e.g: user_id or email address.\nAre you generating the hash with the correct user identifier (user ID vs email)?\nIf you send\nboth user_id and email\n, generate your user_hash with\nuser_id\n.\nIf you send\njust a user_id\n, generate your user_hash with\nuser_id\n.\nIf you send\njust email\n, generate your user_hash with\nemail\n.\nCheck your hashes with the hash checker in your\nSecurity settings\nunderneath your secret key.\nDid you send along the hash value with the key \u201cuser_hash\u201d?\nThe hash you generate should be sent as \u201cuser_hash\u201d along with your Javascript snippet. You cannot call it anything else e.g: \u201candroid_user_hash\u201d.\nIs this the latest version of your code?\nIf this is an older version of your app, or your JavaScript code is cached you might not be sending a user hash with your User data in which case the Messenger won\u2019t load.\nIf you\u2019re still having trouble with Identity Verification, reach out to our support team through the Messenger and we\u2019ll be happy to take a look.

If you have a Messenger integration with\nlogged in users\n, we strongly recommend you use Identity Verification.\n\u26a0\ufe0f\nIdentity Verification is now deprecated\n.\nIdentity Verification is still supported and will continue to work but if you are considering installing it or making changes, we strongly recommend you to\nmigrate to using\nJSON Web Tokens to secure your Messenger\ninstead.\nDo I need Identity Verification?\nIn short, if you have a logged-in Messenger integration, you should set up and enforce Identity Verification.\nIf you only use Intercom for website visitors who don\u2019t login, you don\u2019t need Identity Verification. It only applies to users, for whom you have identifiers like email address or user_id.\nFor more information please see:\nHow do visitors, leads and users work in Intercom?\nWhat is a user impersonation attack?\nOn workspaces without Identity Verification it\u2019s possible for a bad actor to impersonate a user. This means a bad actor could see a user\u2019s historical conversations, appear to your teammates as that user and deceive them into taking actions on that user\u2019s account.\nFor example, without Identity Verification, someone can interact with your Intercom Messenger and spoof the identity of another user, by providing a known identifier like their email address or user_id. This allows an attacker to pose as a real user to your teammates, giving access to previous conversations and potentially sensitive data.\nHow does Identity Verification protect my workspace?\nWith Identity Verification, you generate a unique user hash for each of your users based on their email address or user_id and your workspaces\u2019s identity verification secret (available from your\nIntercom security settings\n). Your integration will generate and send these hashes along with every Messenger request allowing us to trust that the user request truly came from you.\nHere\u2019s how your web Messenger requests are protected from impersonation when you properly enable Identity Verification for your workspace.\nIdentity Verification prevents cross-user impersonation on your workspace because without access to your secret, a third party attempting to spoof a user's identifier to Intercom will be unable to send Intercom a valid user hash for that user.\nOnce Identity Verification is enforced, the Intercom Messenger\nwill not load or accept requests for your logged-in users without a valid user hash\n.\nDoes Identity Verification affect the user experience?\nWith Identity Verification correctly set up, there is no impact to your customers.\nUsers and Leads\nwill experience the Messenger as normal. There is no extra action required from them to authenticate themselves or use the Messenger.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Leads and Users?\nIntercom makes a clear distinction between:\nVisitors\n- unknown customers to your site who aren\u2019t logged in and don\u2019t have a conversation history with you,\nLeads\n- customers who start a conversation with you or reply to a message. They are identified by names like \u201cCharcoal Umbrella from Paris\u201d and receive an Intercom cookie to remember their conversation history,\nUsers\n- customers who sign up to your product and log into an existing account. You usually identify these by email address or user ID\nFor more information please see:\nHow do visitors, leads and users work in Intercom?\nDo I need to set up Identity Verification for visitors?\nWhen Intercom is installed for website visitors who don\u2019t login, you don\u2019t need Identity Verification. It only applies to users, for whom you have identifiers like email address or user_id.\nIn other words, when you enable identity verification for your workspace, Intercom will only expect a user_hash when the Messenger is loaded for a user. However, when the Messenger is loaded for a\nlogged-out visitor/lead\n, a user_hash is not required.\nWhy don\u2019t you have one secret for all platforms?\nWe made a unique secret for each platform so it would be easier to rotate each one or enable Identity Verification on each platform independently.\nHowever, it is now possible to manage your keys yourself and use one key for all platforms. You can find this\nin your Messenger security settings here\nHow do I generate a unique hash per platform when I use the same backend for all users?\nYou shouldn\u2019t generate the hash and store it in your database. You should instead generate it and dynamically send it when identifying the user to Intercom. This will mean that when you change secrets or the user is using a different platform, you\u2019ll have the correct hash being sent.\nIf you store the hash and send it, you\u2019d have to do a mass regeneration upon any changes to your secret which would create friction for you.\nIf you installed Intercom with the rails gem, you don't need to generate a hash on your server and pass it back into us along with the user data. The gem handles the generation of the hash as long as the steps regarding the secret are followed as outlined in the UI.\nDoes Identity Verification protect both user_id and email address values?\nNo, Identity Verification requires you to create a unique hash using the secret and either the user\u2019s user_id or email address. If you send user_ids with your Messenger requests, you have to create the hash using this identifier. If you don\u2019t send user_ids, you generate it with the email address field.\n\u2705 Identity Verification doesn't protect attributes however\nwe do have an improved feature to use JWTs that will allow you to protect all attributes\n.\n\u200b\nSee more here:\nAuthenticating users in the Messenger with JWTs\nMigrating from Identity Verification to JWTs\nWhat are all the domains under 'Active Integrations with logged-in Users'? I don\u2019t recognize them.\nThese are the domains from which we have received a User request with your workspace ID. It may include extra domains if you installed Intercom on other domains for testing. If it contains domains you don\u2019t recognize, we recommend adding a\nTrusted Domains List\n.\nIt\u2019s not possible to remove domains from this list at present but if you can see a domain here, it means we received a ping from it at some point so it\u2019s good to make sure you have correctly set up your integration there so you don\u2019t break the Messenger for some of your users.\nFind out how to set up and\nenable Identity Verification\nfor web and mobile.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSet up Identity Verification for web and mobile [Deprecated]\nTroubleshooting when the Messenger doesn't appear\nTroubleshooting Identity Verification [Deprecated]\nMigrating from Identity Verification to Messenger Security with JWTs"},

Never commit it directly to your repository, client-side code, or anywhere a third party can find it.\nThen choose the server-side language or framework you're using to get your code to generate an HMAC for your app.\nUpdate your site to send the HMAC\nEverywhere you load user data and have a\nwindow.intercomSettings\ncode snippet, add a new attribute called\nuser_hash\nand assign the HMAC code to it.\nWe offer an updated code snippet which includes HMAC value as a parameter sent to the Intercom Messenger. Simply click\nCopy code\nto use it.\nCheck the installation\nOnce you\u2019ve set up Identity Verification and started sending user_hashes for each user, check the installation is working as expected.\nClick on\nCheck the installation.\nThis button will display a table of the domains where the Messenger has been found, as well as their Identity Verification status. A green tick indicates success, and a warning triangle indicates that the Messenger was not found with the correct Identity Verification settings.\nEnsure that you have dealt with all\nerrors\non all the domains in the list. These are all the domains from which we have received a ping.\nYou can also use our\nhash checker\nto verify that the user hash values you're sending over to Intercom are correct, ensuring that Identity Verification will work correctly. Here, you can verify what the expected user hash is based on: user_id or email (if you're not using user_id's).\nAll of your\nping\nrequests must include\nuser_hash\nfor you to enforce Identity Verification on web.\nEnforce Identity Verification for Messenger\nIf you\u2019ve correctly modified your Messenger code and see no errors, you can now enforce Identity Verification by toggling on the option \"Enforce Identity Verification for messenger\" and clicking\nEnforce Identity Verification for messenger.\nThis may take 5-10 seconds to activate.\nOnce enforced, any requests without user hashes will be rejected, preventing impersonation of your users via the Messenger.\nSet up Identity Verification on your mobile app\nSimilarly to the Web installation, you'll find the toggle for iOS, Android & React Native under\nInstall for mobile\n:\nThen retrieve the Identity Verification secret key and store it in a secure place on your server.\nYou should not store the secret key in your mobile app; your server should only send the user_hash to your mobile app.\nNow follow our mobile SDK guides for the platform you\u2019re using:\nEnable Identity Verification in your Android app\n.\nEnable Identity Verification in your iOS app\n.\nOnce you have tested that your Messenger is working as expected in your app, turn off Identity Verification and publish the new Identity Verification-enabled version on the App Store. When you reach a high level of adoption, toggle Identity Verification on, which will then start enforcing it for all versions of your app.\nEnabling Identity Verification will stop old versions of your app communicating with Intercom if they don\u2019t send a valid user_hash.\nHow to turn off Identity Verification\nYou can turn Identity Verification off at any time by navigating to\nSettings > Channels > Messenger > Install\nand scrolling down to the final step of Secure the messenger with Identity Verification on your chosen platform setup to toggle off \"\nEnforce Identity Verification for messenger\n\". This can be useful while you\u2019re developing.\nYour app will be unprotected while Identity Verification is turned off. This means one user of your app could attempt to impersonate another, and see their conversations or modify their data in Intercom.\nHow to rotate your Identity Verification secret\nYou can rotate your identity verification secrets from your workspace. To perform this rotation, do the following:\nCreate a new secret for the needed channel (Web, Android or iOS or one key for all the platforms).\n2. Then, implement the new secret into your code to generate the proper      user_hashes.\n3. Deactivate the old secret and activate the new one.\n4. Refresh the page to view the new secret.\n5. You might need to turn your identity verification off and on again for the new secret to be initialize in case it is not working.\n6. When you make sure everything works as expected, delete the old secret.\nThere will be no downtime during this process.\nAlternatively we can rotate your identity verification secrets for you from our end.\nTo perform this rotation we will need you to contact us directly and do the following:\nDisable identity verification from within Intercom (individually for web, iOS or Android)\nWe will then rotate the specific secret.\nYou will refresh the page to view the new secret.\nYou then will implement the new secret into your code to generate the proper user_hashes.\nLastly, you'll enable identity verification again.\nThere will be no downtime during this process, however, during the completion of steps 2-5 your end-users will be able to use the Messenger without identity verification enabled.\ufeff\nFind out more about\nIdentity Verification\nor try our\ntroubleshooting tips\nif you're experiencing issues with setup.\nNote:\nIdentity Verification has been deprecated in favour of an improved feature using JSON web tokens (JWTs)\nSee more here:\nAuthenticating users in the Messenger with JWTs\nMigrating from Identity Verification to JWTs\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall and use Intercom in your mobile app\nWhat is Identity Verification?

This allows an attacker to pose as a real user to your teammates, giving access to previous conversations and potentially sensitive data.\nIf it helps,\nhere's a video walkthrough\nof the feature and risks it mitigates:\nIf you have a Messenger integration with logged in users, we strongly recommend you secure your Messenger.\nWhat is a JSON web token (JWT)?\nA JSON Web Token (JWT) is an industry standard way to sign data. It typically consists of three parts, separated by dots. A typical JWT looks like this: header.payload.signature.\nThe header specifies the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).\nThe payload contains claims about the user or session (e.g., user_id, email).\nFinally, the signature ensures that the token hasn\u2019t been tampered with, using a secret or private key.\nWhat are the benefits of securing the Messenger with JSON web tokens (JWTs)?\nSecure user identity\n: Securing your messenger allows your teammates to be sure that the user they're talking to, is really that user.\nEnhanced user data security:\nSecuring your Messenger allows for the safe transmission of data attributes about your user through the Messenger API.\nReduced risk from stolen sessions:\nSecuring your Messenger with JWTs allows you to set expiration for the token, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches that could occur if tokens are stolen from your user\u2019s browser. By specifying a short expiration, the risk is lessened.\nSafer Fin and AI workflows\n: Give your complex processes, Actions, and Workflows to Fin, even if they require trustworthy user information.\nBy securely transmitting user identity and data and enforcing token expiration, JWTs ensure your Intercom Messenger is in the most secure state it can be.\nCustomer experience\nWhen using JWTs with the Intercom Messenger, the experience is as follows:\nYour Messenger integration will boot your logged-in user user with an\nIntercom('boot')\nrequest containing a JWT, which includes any and all user data you wish to send to Intercom. The JWT's signature is generated using the Messenger secret key from your settings.\nThen, Intercom will supply the user with a session cookie in their browser. This cookie with a default duration of 7 days. The cookie will be used for its lifetime to authenticate the user and perform any updates to that user.\nIf the session expires, and no fresh JWT is sent, the user's session will end. The user will see a fresh Messenger as a\nlogged-out website visitor\n. It will not contain their conversation history.\nOnce the Messenger is rebooted with\nIntercom('boot')\nand a valid JWT, the Messenger will identify the user and show the user their historical conversations and a new session. We will additionally merge any logged-out activity that occurred on the same device into that authenticated user's account.\nIf you wish for the life of the user's session cookie to be shorter than the default 7 days, you can specify the TTL of the cookie in milliseconds with the session_duration Messenger attribute.\nInstallation: Generating and sending JWTs\nStep 1: Install the Messenger in your application\nYou can find the unique setup instructions for your workspace here. \u200b\nThe main difference between an insecure Messenger setup and a secure setup is that you will include an additional intercomUserJwt field in your user requests and that will be used to identify and update the user.\nYou will see an option to add data attributes into your Javascript snippet. This governs which data you want to send to Intercom. Since you will be using JWTs for transmitting data to us, you should only include attributes here that you don\u2019t want to sign e.g: if you want to send some front-end specific data.\nIf you don\u2019t want to send any data outside the JWT, you can remove all data from your snippet except for the api_base and app_id. Your app_id is the unique identifier for your Intercom workspace.\nStep 2: Start generating JWTs for your users\nYou can use industry standard JWT libraries to generate the token, using the Messenger API Secret as the secret key. Your secret key can be generated in your workspace's Messenger security settings.\nChoose your back and front end frameworks to get relevant code examples for your installation.\nHere is an example for Node.js:\nNote\n: Your Messenger API secret keys as well as the code to generate your JWTs should never be put into front end code. You should always put this server side and secure your secret keys accordingly.\nIf there are additional attributes you want to send about your users (e.g: price_plan or number_of_songs_added) you would add those into your JWT also. user_id is the only required field.\nLearn more about custom data attributes here\n.\nWhen should I include the JWT?\nYou should send a JWT for every request where you are booting a user in the Messenger or trying to update data about them.\nWhat expiry should I set?\nSet a short expiry for your JWT, ensuring that it lives long enough for a full request to reach and be processed by us. Expiry is not a required field but strongly recommended to reduce risk of token replay.\nStep 3: Add JWTs to your Messenger snippet\nWhen launching the Messenger for a logged-in user, you can provide a signed JSON Web Token and assign it to the intercom_user_jwt attribute of the Messenger payload.\nExample Client-Side Configuration\nwindow.Intercom(\"boot\", {\napi_base: \"https://api-iam.intercom.io\",\napp_id: \"APP_ID_CODE\",\nintercom_user_jwt: <YOUR_USER_JWT_TOKEN>,\n};\nThis JWT can contain any user data attributes you want to securely send for the user. Once a valid JWT is received for the user, a session cookie will be created in the user\u2019s browser with a default duration of 7 days.\nTo control the TTL of the Messenger session cookie, you can set a maximum under Settings > Channels > Messenger > General > Keep your Messenger secure\nStep 4: Ensure updates are disabled for your attributes\nIt is possible to enable insecure updates for data attributes for the Messenger API, which means that any update through the Messenger to update that attribute will succeed.\nIf you are sending some data securely in your JWT, you should ensure that you disable insecure Messenger updates for those attributes such that they are only updated via a valid JWT. Note: this toggle does not prevent you from collecting data directly from leads with a bot\nWe recommend you enable this toggle for any attribute you\u2019re sending in your JWT.\nStep 5: Shutdown user sessions on logout\nIntercom allows you to put the Intercom Messenger on any public facing site that you own (your marketing site, your docs site, your developer hub, etc). In order to maintain continuity of conversations across all of these potentially different subdomains while your users are logged in, we set a cookie in your user\u2019s browser. This cookie expires after one week.\nAny user that uses a shared computer and browser with someone else will be able to see the most recently logged in user\u2019s conversation history until the cookie expires. Because of this, it\u2019s very important to properly shutdown Intercom when a user\u2019s session on your app ends (via manually or automatically logging out).\nHere\u2019s how to shutdown Intercom:\nYou will have already begun tracking your user via the Intercom JS snippet or the \u201cboot\u201d method.\nWhen your user logs out of Intercom (or is automatically logged out by your app), call Intercom('shutdown'); from our JavaScript API, to end the Intercom session and clear the cookie.\n\ud83c\udf89 Final step:\nEnforce Messenger Security\nfor your workspace\nWhen your integration is properly sending JWTs for your users, you should enforce Messenger security by toggling it on in your Messenger settings. By doing this, Intercom will require that requests for your workspace users are secured with either a valid JWT or a valid user_hash.\nTroubleshooting guidance\nWe have two tools to help you debug your installation, one way to see recent error logs and a token debugger.\nCheck your installation logs\nOn step 6 under Settings > Channels > Messenger > Security, you will see your installation logs. These will show all failure logs related to your JWT installation. Here you will see errors noting whether your JWTs are invalid, expired etc. You click on \"View log\" to see a full log including the request ID, timestamp, referer and user data. This can help you understand why your request failed and help you trace it back to your own app.\nCommon Error Messages\nHTTP 400 - \"user_hash and intercom_user_jwt cannot be provided simultaneously\"\n: The request included both a JWT and a user_hash. Customers should include either of these values, but not both.\nHTTP 400 - \u201cMissing user_id in payload\u201d\n: All JWTs are expected to include user_id as part of the payload. If a customer considers \u201cemail\u201d their primary identifier, they should put the email value into both the user_id and email fields in the payload.\nHTTP 400 - \u201cInvalid intercom_user_jwt payload\u201d\n: The JWT payload is invalid. Customers should ensure the payload is well-formed, encoded, and signed with a SHA256 HMAC using the api_secret value as the signing secret.\nHTTP 400 - \u201cIntercom_user_jwt expired\u201d\n: The JWT \u2018exp\u2019 is a timestamp in the past. Customers should provide an expiration date in the future.\nHTTP 400 - \u201cJWT identity mismatch\"\n: User ID provided in the JWT does not match the user associated with the active intercom session cookie. This would indicate that there's an attempt to start two competing sessions. Ensure you are calling\nIntercom('shutdown')\nbefore attempting to boot a new user.\nHTTP 400 - \"Invalid intercom_user_jwt\"\n: Ensure you are properly booting a valid user.\nJWT decoder\nOur decoder tool also gives you a way to check a JSON web token. You can find it on the sidebar on the installation pages.\nIn the tool you can check one of your generated user JWTs for validity. Choose the relevant secret key you used to generate the JWT and click Decode.\nOnce decoded you can see the user details from your JWT's payload, the header and a note as to whether it's valid or invalid. Seeing the payload can be useful to help troubleshoot whether you are sending an attribute or not.\nIn this example I have used both an invalid secret and I'm not including the user_id field, both of which will cause a failure.\nFAQs\nWhy is user_id required within the JWT? My users only have email addresses.\nYou now need to provide user_id as your primary identifier for users. Historically, we\u2019ve supported either user_id or email as potential identifiers, but this has created significant product confusion in basic Identity Verification.\nIf you only have an email to identify your users with, you can supply the email address in both the user_id and email attributes of the payload. However, if you currently already have your users in Intercom with just an email address, you'll have to update them to have a user ID before you can use JWTs. This is because the user ID is a higher order identifier for users than email address.\nTo add user ID for your users, first identify the user with the\nIntercom ID\nfor the user. You can do this via our API with \"\nGet a contact\n\" endpoint. Then use the \"\nUpdate a Contact\n\" endpoint to add a user_id to the user.\nMore details here\nHow do I set this up for non-logged in users, where I don't have a user_id?\nThe Messenger security feature requires your users to have unique user IDs that you provide. If you're just using the Messenger for leads, you can't identify them this way. You should ensure that the Messenger APIs are disabled for user traffic, since you're not expecting user traffic through this channel.\n\u200b\nYou can do this in\nMessenger > Install\n. Choose the install method you're using (web, iOS, Android) and check that the \"Enable connection to messenger\" toggle is\noff\nfor users.\nWhat should I set my expiration to?\nYou should send a new JWT each time the Messenger is booted, and so the lifetime of the token only needs to support the length of time between Messenger launches. Choose the minimum duration that is suitable for their application\u2019s behavior. If the web page is often reloaded, the JWT should be short-lived, though we suggest a minimum of 5 minutes to prevent unexpected expiry issues.\nWhat signing algorithm can I use?\nWe support HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256). This algorithm uses a shared secret key to sign and verify the token, ensuring that the data within the token has not been tampered with.\nCan I send both a user_hash and intercom_user_jwt?\nNo, we don\u2019t support sending both the user_hash and the intercom_user_jwt, as the `user_hash` should be superseded by JWTs. You can, however, alternate between sending user_hashes and/or intercom_user_jwt values, as some customers will need to do this as they migrate from user_hash to intercom_user_jwt\nIf you're currently using Identity Verification and sending user hashes, see this guide for changing your integration to send JWTs instead.\nHow can I check that my JWTs are valid and things are working?\nSee Troubleshooting section above.\nHow do I enforce the requirement for JWTs for my workspace?\nYou should enable the enforcement toggle in your Messenger settings.\nWhat attributes should I protect?\nAll identifying attributes should be marked protected and sent securely in the JWT if possible. This includes, email, phone, and any account_ids the customer may store on the User record. You can find your attributes in\nSettings > Data > People\n.\nAny attribute that you want Fin to use in a critical part of an Action or Workflow should be protected, to ensure a malicious user cannot override that value.\nIf you want to send data outside the JWT, you can do that as long as you have allowed Messenger updates but keep in mind that a user could update this field themselves.\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\napp_id: <APP_ID_CODE>,\nintercom_user_jwt: <TOKEN>,\nunsigned_data_attribute: 'data'\n};\nWhat if the session expires in the middle of the user doing something?\nIf there is activity within the Messenger from a user after the cookie expires, Intercom will issue a fresh short lived cookie of 1 hour to avoid negative impact to the user experience. To prevent any unintended effects to the user experience we recommend you choose a session duration of the cookie that matches that of your application\u2019s session timeout.\nWhat about my mobile Messenger?\nYou can see instructions for iOS\nhere\nand Android\nhere\n! We don't have React Native support just yet but when it's available, you'll see it\nhere\n.\nWhy don\u2019t we require the full payload to be signed?\nWe allow for customers to send un-signed Attributes to support situations where they need to send low-fidelity data about the User, while the User is taking action in their application. If the customer doesn\u2019t need this capability, they can update all their User Data Attributes to be \u201cprotected from Messenger updates\u201d and only send the signed payload.\nHow do I manage and rotate my Messenger secret keys?\nYour secret key can be generated in your workspace's Messenger security settings.\nYou can find and copy your existing keys on the right hand sidebar of the JWT setup page.\nYou can rotate keys in\nWorkspace > Security > Messenger\n.\nWhat happened to Identity Verification? Does this replace that?\nIdentity Verification is the previous iteration of Messenger Security which works using HMAC user hashes to identify that a user request was sent by your integration.\n\u200b\nWhile user_hashes will continue to be accepted, we strongly recommend all customers upgrade to using JWTs as it gives more security benefits and Identity Verification will not receive any future updates.\nIf you need to manage your Identity Verification installation from the JWT pages, you still can. The instructions have been updated to reflect the JWT setup, and if you're making changes we strongly recommend you to move to JWTs, but if you need to disable the feature or rotate your Messenger API secret keys, you can still achieve this from the JWT setup page.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSet up Identity Verification for web and mobile [Deprecated]\nWhat is Identity Verification?

We also have people who've successfully built a number of startups from scratch, and others who have worked in well-established smaller Internet businesses.\nWe host in world-class facilities\nThe vast majority of our services and data are hosted in Amazon Web Services facilities in the USA. Further details about the considerable measures Amazon takes in securing their facilities and services can be found\nhere\n.\nWe follow best practices\nAt Intercom we follow a number of best practices that improve our security posture.\nHere are a few examples:\nWe have reliable, frequently used automation in place so that we can safely and reliably roll out changes to both our application and operating platform within minutes. We typically deploy dozens of times a day, so we have high confidence that we can get a security fix out quickly when required.\nAll data sent to Intercom is encrypted in transit. Our API and application endpoints are TLS/SSL only and score an \"A+\" rating on SSL Labs' tests - meaning that we only use strong cipher suites and have features such as HSTS and Perfect Forward Secrecy fully enabled. We also encrypt data at rest.\nWe regularly engage with well-regarded third-party auditors to audit our codebase and infrastructure, and work with them to resolve potential issues.\nOur infrastructure is managed as code with Terraform. We use technologies such as\nElasticsearch\n,\nAWS CloudTrail\nand\nPantherLabs\nto provide an audit trail over our infrastructure and the Intercom application. Auditing allows us to do ad-hoc security analysis, track changes made to our setup and audit access to every layer of our stack.\nWe use two-factor authentication whenever possible. We ask vendors to enforce two-factor authentication in all our accounts. We discourage use of shared accounts on any system - when we have no choice we use\n1Password\nto securely share logins. We review which accounts can access our systems and the permissions they have regularly.\nWe don't trust our corporate network - it has no backdoors into our production systems.\nWe have a documented incident response plan and educate all staff on security procedures and policies.\nExternal penetration testing twice a year performed by dedicated external security partners.\nRunning continuous scans on our main web properties using\nDetectify\n.\nAny changes to the Intercom codebase have been peer reviewed and are automatically tested as part of our CI/CD process to identify any regression or security flaws using static analysis.\nRunning a public bug bounty program with\nBugcrowd\n.\nMore details are available on our\nSecurity\npage and in our\nTrust Center\n.\nIntercom's product security features\nSecurity has a shared responsibility. You should enable the following product security features to enhance the security of your workspace.\nWorkspace security\nThese features help you to secure your Intercom workspace and protect your data.\nUse\n2FA, Google Sign-On or SAML SSO\nto protect your account.\nRole-based access controls\n- set roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive data and features.\nIP allowlisting\n- restrict workspace access to specific IP addresses.\nCustom session length\n- control how long teammates stay authenticated by setting custom session durations.\nTeammate activity logs\n- monitor and audit important actions taken by teammates on your workspace.\nLink security\n- protect teammates from accessing malicious links by enabling link warnings and creating policies to manage links and domains in your workspace.\nPAN redaction\n- automatically detect and redact payment card numbers (PANs) from conversations.\nAttachment security\n- control how attachments are used in your workspace.\nMessenger security\nThese features protect your Messenger installation and help secure communications with your customers.\nSecure your Messenger with JWTs\n- prevent cross-user impersonation in the Messenger by verifying user identity and protecting data attributes.\nAdd a trusted domains list\nto ensure the Messenger is only loaded on domains you own and care about.\nDisable attribute creation via the Messenger\nto prevent bad actors from inserting their own data through the browser.\nUse the\nIntercom JavaScript shutdown method\nto end a session for a user when they log out of your app.\nYou can learn more about these features in the\nSecurity & Privacy\nand\nMessenger Security\nsections of our Help Center.\nWe do not store payment details\nIntercom is not in the business of storing or processing payments.

It must be an X.509 certificate.\nIf your identity provider supports it, you can also define a session duration in your identity provider's configuration, which sets the length of time before a teammate's session expires and they must log in to Intercom again. If this is not set, the default duration is 3.5 days.\nNext, specify the domains which are allowed to authenticate with SAML SSO. Enter a domain under \u201cAllowed domains\u201d, and click \u201cAdd domain\u201d:\nTo ensure that all of your team are able to log in successfully with SAML SSO before disabling other login methods, you should leave these options toggled on:\nTo uncheck this option and enforce SAML SSO as the\nrequired\nlogin method, you must be logged in with SAML SSO. You can do this after saving your settings.\nThen, you must verify that you own the domain by adding a\nTXT record\nin your DNS settings with the values shown here:\nIf you do not have access to your DNS provider, you may need help from someone on your team.\nAfter adding the TXT record in your DNS settings, click \u201cVerify DNS record\u201d:\nIf you have just created the DNS record it may still be propagating, in this case you\u2019ll see the following warning message: \u201c\nUnable to verify DNS record. Please try again later.\u201d\nOnce the DNS record is verified, you\u2019ll see a success message and the domain will appear here:\nIf you need to add more than one domain, repeat this process for the others. \ud83d\udc4c\nSign in with SAML SSO\nOnce SAML SSO is enabled, teammates have the ability to login using it.\nEmail not registered for a SAML account\nIf the email entered on the SAML login page does not match any teammates that belong to a workspace with SAML SSO enabled, then the teammate sees an error message.\nEmail registered for\none\nSAML account\nIf the email matches a workspace with SAML SSO, then the user is directly redirected to the identity providers he/she uses, and asked to log in.\nEmail registered for\nmultiple\nSAML account\nIf the email matches multiple workspace with SAML SSO, then we show them the\nworkspace selector\nwhere they can select the workspace they want to login in to.\nDepending on the identity provider the teammate has for each workspace, the teammate is redirected to the right identity provider's login experience. After performing the log in, the user is brought back to the correct workspace and logged in.\nSAML Support when switching accounts\nSAML SSO is supported when changing in between workspaces:\nWhen the teammate wants to switch to a workspace where they are logged in, the switch happens without friction. If not, the teammate is redirected to the\nworkspace selector\nand is asked to log in once.\nScenario:\nWhen a teammate is logged into two workspaces using similar SAML SSO providers, then no need to re-auth to switch between workspaces.\nIf the teammate has access to a third workspace with password as the auth method, and the teammate hasn\u2019t logged in, then we redirect them to the workspace switcher to log in once with password.\nSign in to Intercom Conversations app with SAML SSO\nOnce SAML SSO is configured, navigate to the log in screen of your iOS or Android\nIntercom Conversations app\n.\nClick the\nSign in with SAML SSO\nbutton at the bottom of the login page.\nEnter the work email you use to sign into Intercom and click\nContinue\nto show a list of workspaces you can sign into (as pictured below).\nIf you only have access to one workspace, this screen will be skipped and the single workspaces will be autoselected to sign into.\nSelecting a workspace will present a web view where you will need to login to your SAML provider.\nOnce sign in with the SAML provider has been completed successfully, you will be logged into the app.\nIf you don\u2019t have SAML SSO set up for your account and try to log in with SAML SSO, you'll see an error message.\nGoogle Workspace SSO troubleshooting\nIf you are using Google Workspace as your SSO provider and you see an error message stating that you don\u2019t have access (similar to the image below), you can\nturn on remediation messages\nin order to further understand the reason for the error.\nOnce enabled, you'll be able to see more detailed information in the error message.\nFor example, the following error could indicate that the device which is being used is not managed by\nGoogle endpoint management\n:\nWorkspace invites\nSAML SSO is also compatible with workspace invites. When redeeming the invite, it fails if the invite email doesn't match email returned by identity providers. Otherwise the invite can be redeemed.\nChoose to enable Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning\nJust-in-Time provisioning will automatically add teammates to your Intercom workspace the first time they sign in with SAML SSO, if they don\u2019t already have an Intercom account.\nTo enable this, go to\nSettings > Workspace > Security\n, make sure SAML SSO is toggled on, and click on\nProvisioning\n:\nThen,\ndefine which permissions\nnew teammates should have when added by JIT provisioning:\nNew teammates will only be added if you have available\nseats\n.\nFinally, save your settings, and test your configuration by authenticating with your identity provider:\nOnce your workspace has SAML SSO enabled with any provider, teammates will be unable to edit their own email address from their\nAccount security\npage. The email field will be read-only.\nConfiguring SAML with OneLogin\nIt\u2019s easy to configure SAML SSO with OneLogin. Just use the Intercom app in the OneLogin store.\nGo to \u201cApplications\u201d in your admin page and click \u201cAdd App\u201d:\nThen, search for the \u201cIntercom SAML 2.0\u201d app, and add it:\nAfter adding the Intercom app, open the Configuration tab, and enter the SAML name for your workspace:\nOn the SSO tab, copy the \"SAML 2.0 Endpoint\" URL and paste it in\nyour workspace's SAML settings\n:\nFinally, click \u201cView Details\u201d under the certificate and copy this to Intercom too:\nNow you can authenticate with OneLogin and save your settings in Intercom, and you\u2019re ready to go. \ud83d\udc4c\nIf your workspace is hosted in EU or AU reach out to the OneLogin team to make sure your integration is supported.\nConfiguring SAML SSO with Okta\nEasily set up SAML SSO with the Intercom app in the Okta app store.\nGo to \u201cAdd Application\u201d in your admin page and search for Intercom. Click \u201cAdd\u201d:\nProceed to step 2, and view the setup instructions:\nThese instructions are tailored to your Okta account and contain the following:\nIdentity provider issuer URL.\nPublic certificate.\nYou must copy and paste these values into\nyour workspace's SAML settings\n.\nAfter adding the URL and certificate, return to Okta and enter your workspace\u2019s SAML name under \u201cAdvanced sign-on settings\u201d:\nSee above for instructions on how to find your SAML name\n.\nNext, save the Encryption Certificate provided by Okta as\nintercom.pem\nand upload it here:\nNow you can save your settings in Okta and then confirm the authentication in Intercom, and you\u2019re all set. \ud83d\udc4c\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nProtect your account with 2FA, Google Sign-On or SAML SSO\nReview actions taken in your workspace with Teammate activity logs\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) Provisioning\nAccept an invite to an Intercom workspace"},

We delay sending emails for 3 minutes (if you have this enabled). If a user reads the message in the Messenger before those time periods, neither are sent.\nPush notifications\nWe wait 10 seconds before sending a push notification to the user. If the user has seen the message within 10 seconds, no push notification is sent.\nNote that delivery speed for push notifications is variable.\nIt's currently not possible to send a push message with the Intercom mobile app.\nBrowser and audio notifications\nThese are always sent immediately.\nAudio notifications trigger for all teammate messages, even if you're viewing the conversation.\nBrowser tab alerts appear in all tabs. You have to close each tab individually to make them go away.\nEmail notifications for Conversations\nBy default, when Intercom sends email notifications to your users or leads, it includes a summary of the conversation so far, and the recipient can reply directly to continue the conversation. These notifications will send when a teammate's message hasn't been seen by a user in the Messenger after 3 minutes.\nWe group email notifications so multiple replies are consolidated to one email, which is sent once there has been no new reply in the last 3 minutes.\nEmail notifications will only send for conversations that have had a reply from a teammate. If you send an outbound Chat to a user, it will not also send via email. The user or teammate must first reply to turn it into a conversation.\nYou can enable or disable email notifications from\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\nin the \u201cEmail notifications\u201d section.\nEmail notifications sent to users will use a plain email template with an avatar & the name of the teammate. It is not possible to edit the template.\nYour logo set in the Messenger settings, will be displayed as a signature in such email notifications:\nContentless email notifications\nIf you wish to keep your conversation content private, you can do so with contentless notifications. This allows you to keep conversations in the Messenger and does not allow the customer to reply to the email notification. Check out how to set this up\nhere\n.\nConversation history controls\nYou can decide whether conversation history is shown in emails that you send through Intercom. Removing conversation history means that only the message itself is shown to participants, and no previous conversation history is carried over when you send an email. Check out how to enable/disable this\nhere\n.\nEmail notifications for Tickets\nYou can choose to enable email notifications if a ticket status update hasn't been seen by a user after 3 minutes.\nA new ticket submission triggers an email notification immediately (the 3 minute delay does not apply).\nThese can be enabled or disabled separately from conversation email notifications in\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\n.\nTicket status email notifications will only send for tickets you have shared with the user (i.e. Back-office tickets will not send email notifications for status updates).\nRead more about Ticket notifications\nhere\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow teammates get notifications\nCreate outbound chat and post messages\nSending email notifications without conversation content or history\nHow customers get notified about tickets\nMulti-brand push notifications"},
{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8838656-inbox-faqs", "title": "Inbox FAQs", "content": "General\nDoes Intercom have keyboard shortcuts?\nYes, Intercom Inbox has several keyboard shortcuts that let you perform common actions without using your mouse. It currently isn't possible to disable or customise the shortcuts.\nUse\n\u2318/Ctrl K\nwhen you're viewing your inbox/a conversation to access the Command-K action menu and then scroll down to locate\nKeyboard shortcuts\nto see all available options.\nTo access the Command-K action menu, simply press the following keystrokes:\n\u2318 K\non Mac.\nCtrl K\non Windows.\nDirect shortcuts are supported on English (QWERTY), French (AZERTY), Brazilian Portuguese, Latin American Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, and other non-Latin language keyboards using Chrome or Edge browsers.\nHow do I automatically remove hyperlinks from inbound emails?\nBy default, hyperlinks will be shown in all inbound emails you receive in the Inbox. To disable links from being rendered in emails from customers, go to\nSettings > Channels > Email > Advanced\nand turn on \"Strip links from emails\".\nAll HTML content will still be rendered, but none of the links will be clickable. This means that attackers will not be able to conceal links to malicious sites around an element in the email.\nURLs can still be rendered in plain text. For example, an email can contain the text\nhttp://go-to-this-site.com\nand it will be rendered, but it will not be clickable.\nSwitching this toggle on:\nWill not impact older conversations from the time of switching.\nWill not impact links in the Messenger and other channels' conversations.\nWill also strip out links from conversation history.\nWill not affect teammate\u2019s ability to add links.\nLinks are accessible for 14 days after the email is sent through viewing the raw email. The raw email is held for 14 days and after that time is no longer available.\nHow does spam filtering work?\nIntercom has a sophisticated built-in spam filtering system that automatically checks incoming emails for hidden links, malware, phishing attempts, and proper authentication of sender's address. We assign all inbound emails a spam score and filter messages that exceed our spam threshold.\nIf you\u2019re missing some messages that you think may have been incorrectly filtered, you can check the\nSpam folder\nfrom the Inbox.\n\u200b\nYou may need to pin the Spam folder first if you can't see it on the Inbox sidebar:\nGo to the\nInbox\n.\nClick on\nManage\nat the bottom of the left sidebar.\nSelect\nEdit sidebar\nand then 'pin' the\nSpam\nfolder to the sidebar.\nYou will find any messages filtered as spam in this folder. If any have been filtered incorrectly, you can mark the message as\nNot spam\nand send it back to the inbox it was originally intended for.\n\u200b\nNote:\nEmails within the spam inbox are deleted after 2 months.\nHow do I block Inbox spam?\nYou can delete any abusive, offensive or spammy users by blocking the user who sent the message. Just select the dropdown from the top right corner of their user profile and click\nBlock\n.\nAll of the information stored about that user, including their messages, will be archived from Intercom. The user can only be restored manually by you and any new messages from that email address will be rejected. The user will also be prevented from creating a new user account in the future.\nThe web integration will now return a 400 error whenever a blocked user\u2019s data is passed to Intercom via ping.\nHow to unblock a user\nIf, however, you block a user by accident, you can easily unblock them. Just go to your\nPeople settings\nand select the\nBlocked\ntab.\nYou\u2019ll see a list of your blocked users. Hover over a profile to select\nUnblock\non the profile you would like to reactivate. Your user's information will now be restored.\nAfter you unblock the user, they'll immediately return to your user list.\nTip:\nIf they don't appear in your user list immediately, hard refresh your page.\nNote:\nIf users show up with email/name as \"Unknown\" this means this information was not present on their contact when they were blocked.\nWhat are the best practices for preventing and managing spam in Intercom?\nSpam can disrupt your teammates and clutter your inbox, but there are several effective ways to prevent and manage it in your Intercom workspace:\n1. Use Geographical Targeting\nHide the Messenger\nfrom locations you don\u2019t serve.\nConfigure \u201cShow the Messenger launcher\u201d to exclude specific countries.\nFilter access by\ncountry, region, city, or continent code\nto limit unwanted interactions.\n2. Enable Email Verification\nActivate \u201cRequire an email before a conversation starts\u201d in the Messenger using\nSimple automations\n.\nThis adds a barrier against bots and low-effort spammers, however, determined spammers may still use fake email addresses.\n3. Set Up Keyword-Based Workflows\nAutomate\nmessage filtering with a workflow\nwhich closes conversations that contain specific spam keywords.\nCan be used for conversations over any channel (chat, email, social, etc.)\nHelps maintain a clean inbox and minimizes manual moderation.\nBy implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce spam while ensuring that legitimate customers can still reach you.\nWhy does a conversation show in a view for \"team assigned\" when it does not appear in the inbox I'm filtering for?\nIn an inbox view, we evaluate team assignee and teammate assignee separately.

To have the Inbox view work the same as the Team Inbox, you would have to add the rule \"Teammate Assigned is None\" in addition to the \"team assigned\" rule.\nCan I send voice notes in the Inbox?\nNo, it's not possible to send voice notes or voice replies in the Inbox.

If you are unable to find it there, you can also try searching for the client's name or email address using the search function in the Inbox.\nHow can I search for contacts based on their phone number from the Inbox?\nThe Inbox search bar performs a keyword search, so it searches for characters within a conversation/ticket, rather than actual customer data. If the phone number hasn't been typed out in a message or customer reply, it won't return results. However, if you have a\ncustom data attribute\nfor 'Phone number' in your workspace, you can filter conversations by this attribute.\nWhy isn't the company data updating when I search for a conversation in the inbox?\nIf you've changed participants in a conversation, when you search for that conversation in your inbox, the company data will not update.

In these circumstances, we\u2019ll surface the error message that their email provider sent back to us when we tried to deliver the email.\nWhen the customer\u2019s email provider sends back the error, we add a note to the conversation to surface the error message, along with the email address that couldn't receive your reply.\nThese are errors that Intercom has no control over.

For example, if the recipient\u2019s mailbox is full, or they have changed their email address.\nWhen receiving errors like this, you can either try sending again later, or reach out to the customer through another address or channel if available.\nCommon delivery errors\nThese are some error codes that are commonly received when an attempt to deliver an email fails, along with a description of what they usually mean.\nError code\nWhat it means\n550\nThis can mean a variety of different things, such as the recipient address not existing, the email being filtered as spam, or the mailbox being full. The error message usually provides more detailed information about what\u2019s going wrong.\n550-5.1.1\nThis typically means that the email address you are trying to send to is not valid. The recipient may have closed their email account, or there may be a typo in their email address.\n550-5.7.1\nThis error is often associated with issues related to email security, spam, or policy violations. The email may have triggered spam or virus protection filters, failed authentication checks, or been rejected due to policy violations related to the source or content.\n552-5.2.2\nThis indicates that the recipient's mailbox is full and cannot accept any more messages until space is freed up.\n554-5.4.4\nThis typically means that the recipient's mail server could not find a route to deliver your email. DNS may be misconfigured on their mail server, there may be policy restrictions that block certain types of email, or there may be a temporary issue with the server or network.\n554-5.4.7\nThis typically means that the recipient's mail server could not find a route to deliver your email.

It's currently not possible to merge Back-office or Tracker tickets.\nConversations or tickets with multiple participants\ncannot\nbe merged.\nNow search for the conversation or ticket to merge into and select it from the list.\nThis search supports queries by\nConversation content, Conversation title, and Conversation or Ticket ID.\nMerged conversations will still have their own tracking/reporting/API details associated to when the conversation is started even after merging\nYou will then see a preview of what you are merging to help you verify that you are merging the correct items.\nIf you're merging conversations from different users, the users in the merged (secondary) conversation will be added to the primary conversation. If this is the case, you\u2019ll be shown an additional message to confirm that the users will be added. Keep in mind that merging can't be reversed and may result in sharing conversation history with participants.\nMerging conversations and tickets from different channels\nConversations and tickets that started on different channels can be merged together. For example, a user may contact you via the Messenger, then again by email. You can merge the email conversation into the Messenger conversation to maintain a single place for handling their issue.\nNote:\nNot all channels support merging into conversations on other channels. See\nMerge conversation/ticket capabilities\nfor more information.\nOnce merged, you\u2019ll see a notification confirming that the conversations have been successfully merged, with a link to continue the conversation from the primary thread.\nThe primary conversation will also have a notification in the thread to show another conversation has been merged into this one.\nMerging conversations and tickets from different users\nMerging conversation and tickets from different users is also supported, but it is disabled by default to prevent unintentional data sharing.\nTo enable cross-user merging, go to\nSettings > Workspace > Security > Data Security Settings\nand select \"Enable cross-user conversation merging\".\nOnce enabled, conversations and tickets from\ndifferent users\nwill be available to select when you initiate a merge. All participants of the merged (secondary) conversation will be added to the primary conversation.\nAfter the merge, if the primary conversation is on Messenger, the participants on the primary conversation will see that participants of the secondary conversation have been added.\nMessenger experience\nWhen a Messenger conversation has been merged into another conversation, the user won\u2019t be able to reply to the secondary conversation any longer.\nIf they are able to access the primary conversation within the Messenger, they'll be able to click on a button to take them there.\nHowever, the button won't appear if the primary conversation isn\u2019t accessible in the Messenger, for example, if it's an email conversation.\nNote:\nSupport for this in the Mobile Messenger is available with iOS SDK version 18.7.2 and Android SDK version 15.16.1. In earlier versions the \"Continue the conversation\" button will always appear in the Mobile Messenger. In scenarios where the user can\u2019t access the primary conversation in the Messenger, the button won\u2019t do anything.\nMerge conversation/ticket capabilities\nThere are some constraints around which conversations/tickets can be merged together:\nSecondary\nPrimary\nAllowed?\nMessenger\nMessenger\nYes \u2705\nMessenger\nEmail\nYes \u2705\nEmail\nEmail\nYes \u2705\nEmail\nMessenger\nYes \u2705\nPhone call\nPhone call\nYes \u2705\nPhone call\nEmail\nYes \u2705\nPhone call\nMessenger\nYes \u2705\nCustomer ticket\nCustomer ticket\nYes \u2705\nConversation\nCustomer ticket\nYes \u2705\nCustomer ticket\nConversation\nNo \u274c\nNote:\nWhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram conversations can only be merged into conversations from the same user and on the same channel.\nReport on merged conversations/tickets\nConversation and tickets that have been merged will be included in all report metrics by default. You can track merged conversations by applying a filter using the custom attribute \u201c\nMerged\nis true\u201d. This will display all conversations that have been merged, or you can exclude merged conversations from your report by selecting \"\nMerged\nis false\".\nFAQs\nCan I merge conversations from different users?\nYes, you can merge conversations from different users, but there are some\nconstraints\n.\nHow does merging affect SLAs?\nIf the secondary has an active SLA, this will be removed and the SLA of the primary conversation will be used instead.\nWill a secondary user see the full conversation history?\nIf\nconversation history is turned on\n, new participants may see the full thread of the primary conversation. However, teammates can always\nremove participants\nif necessary.\nCan I merge Customer tickets across users?\nYes, you can merge Customer tickets from different users, and the secondary user will be added as a participant in the primary ticket.\nCan I merge Back-office or Tracker tickets?\nNo, you can only merge\nCustomer tickets\nor conversations.\nWhat happens when I merge two tickets with different statuses?\nWhen tickets with different statuses are merged, the secondary ticket will assume the status of the primary ticket.\nCan a conversation be merged more than once?\nYes, conversations can be merged multiple times \u2014 just not all at once. For example: Conversation A is merged into Conversation B. Later, Conversation B can still be merged into Conversation C, and so on.\nCan I reply to a secondary conversation?\nNo, once a conversation has been merged you cannot send any new messages in the secondary conversation.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nMerge lead and user profiles\nManage group conversations in the Inbox\nTickets portal explained\nTickets portal setup\nAuto-convert conversations to tickets"},

This makes their responses more personal, as they are also well adjusted to their personal tone. They use it to make replies more fun and engaging. Also, they\u2019ll use it when they feel like their response is a little awkward. It gives them a new way to say the same thing with clarity.\nMake more formal\n- Some teammates like using the \u2018Make more formal\u2019 feature because it helps them tune-up their language in cases where that\u2019s appropriate.\nSummarize -\nSupport reps are using 'Summarize' when handing over conversations or escalating to a different team and bringing them up to speed quickly. The summaries help other teams get caught up with the specifics efficiently and allows them to determine next steps quicker. They also use it to summarize very long conversations, helping reps get up to speed quicker.\nExpand\n- Help center content creators are turning simple bullet points and short summaries into an instant first draft with\nAI Articles\n.\nMetadata in the Intercom API\nAI summaries are also available via the Intercom API.

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/7996715-email-threading", "title": "Email threading", "content": "With email threading all email replies that relate to each other are threaded into a single conversation. This allows teammates to view the context about an email thread, together, in one place, rather than needing to split their attention across multiple conversations. Email threading also prevents email threads going through workflows multiple times or getting assigned to different teammates who may not have the right context.\nThere are specific pieces of information on an email that we use to determine whether or not an email should be threaded into an existing conversation. All emails contain pieces of metadata called\nheaders,\nand we use specific headers in emails to determine when and how to thread an email:\nMessage-ID\n: Every email sent has a unique identifier and that is put into the Message-ID header. It typically looks somewhat like an email address, e.g. <\n1234567890@example.com\n>. The email provider that sends the email generates this.\nIn-Reply-To\n: When you send a reply to an email, the email provider typically puts the Message-ID of the email you\u2019re replying to into the In-Reply-To header.\nReferences\n: Similar to the In-Reply-To header this typically contains the Message-ID of the email that was replied to, but it can also contain some or all of the Message-IDs for emails from earlier in the thread.\nFor emails you have received in Intercom you can view these headers by hovering over the email icon on the bottom left-hand corner of the message and clicking on \u2018\nView raw email\u2019\n.\nWhen an email is received into your workspace, we take its References and In-Reply-To headers. We use those to look for a conversation in your workspace containing an email with a Message-ID that\u2019s referenced by those headers. If we find one, we thread the new email into that conversation.\nExternal senders\nIn some circumstances, an email will be threaded into a conversation from an \u2018external sender\u2019. This happens when someone who hasn\u2019t been included in any of the emails so far sends an email that references an email from the conversation in its In-Reply-To or References headers.\nThis can happen when a participant in the conversation Bcc\u2019s someone or forwards an email from the conversation to someone. If that person replies and one of your workspace addresses or forwarding addresses in the To or Cc fields, we add their reply into the same conversation. This allows you to maintain context about the same email thread all together in the same conversation.\nTheir reply will contain a warning banner to tell the teammate that the person wasn\u2019t previously seen in the conversation, and they were not CC\u2019d by another participant.\nThe sender won\u2019t be added as a participant into the conversation. The teammate can choose to add them as a participant in the conversation so that they can be included in future replies.\nWhy is the email reply not threading into an existing conversation?\nSome email clients will strip out some of all of the headers from emails which Intercom uses to thread replies into a conversation. When this happens we don\u2019t have a reliable way of finding the conversation to thread the email into. Email clients and servers have a wide range of features and behaviours that may lead to this happening.\nOne other circumstance where an email will split into a new conversation applies to conversations that started on the Messenger, and later had one or more participants added by email. The user in the Messenger will be given an alias email address when their replies are sent to the other participants of the conversation. That alias email address looks like this:\nalice.jones.onchat@examply.intercom-mail.com\n. If one of the conversation participants removes this email address from the\nTo\nor\nCc\nfields when replying to the conversation, their reply will split out into a new conversation.\nWhy did an email thread into a conversation when I didn\u2019t expect it to?\nUsers may forward emails sent on a conversation to other people, or\nBcc\nothers into their replies. If those people reply and include one of your workspace or forwarding email addresses as a recipient, it\u2019s likely that the relevant References or In-Reply-To headers will be present, and we\u2019ll thread their reply into the conversation. You can read more about this behaviour in\nManage group conversations in the Inbox\n.\nSome email clients split emails into new threads when the subject line changes in a meaningful way. This doesn\u2019t happen in Intercom.\nWhy are emails not threading in my email client?\nEmail clients and servers have a wide range of features and behaviours that may lead to this happening. Some have explicit settings for enabling and disabling threading, so it is worth checking those settings if they exist in your client. Email clients also have varying behaviour in terms of which email headers need to be present in order for emails to thread together, or they may split conversations based on subject line or recipient changes.\nOld behavior (conversations older than 12th July 2023)\nPreviously, in email conversations we set the ReplyTo address for each email to a unique address for each conversation that looks like this:\nn+u_xxxx@examply.intercom-mail.com\nYou can now send and receive emails from the actual email addresses of conversation participants, and reply directly to each participant in the conversation. This allows you to clearly see who you're talking to and add control over who will receive your message by allowing you to remove people you don\u2019t want to send to, or add more people in CC.\nOld behavior\nNew behavior\nWhen recipients change\nWhen a user replies to an email conversation and removes one or more of the other users who received the original email, their reply will split out into a new conversation.\nE.g. Alice emails\nsupport@example.com\n(Intercom) and CCs Bob and Carol. Bob replies to Alice and\nsupport@example.com\n, but removes Carol from CC. His email creates a second conversation in Intercom.\nEmail replies to a conversation that have been sent to only a subset of participants will be added to that conversation instead of starting a new one.\nE.g. Alice emails\nsupport@example.com\n(Intercom) and CCs Bob and Carol. Bob replies to Alice and\nsupport@example.com\n, but removes Carol from CC. Bob\u2019s email is threaded into Alice\u2019s conversation in Intercom. Though Carol is a participant of the conversation she doesn\u2019t receive Bob\u2019s email.\nEmail headers and replying\nEmails sent on a group conversation have an \u2018n+u\u2019 email address in the ReplyTo header. When the user replies, they reply to that address and their reply is added to the conversation in the Inbox for the teammate to see. Then their message is emailed out individually to all of the participants of the conversation.\nN+u addresses are no longer used in the ReplyTo header. Instead, when a teammate replies in a group conversation their message will be sent in a single email to all participants in the conversation, with those participants email addresses in the To and Cc headers. When users reply to those emails they will be replying directly to each of the participants, plus the Intercom email address used to send the message to them (e.g.\nbob.oneill@examply.intercom-mail.com\n). That means we no longer send on users\u2019 replies to every participant. Only the recipients who the user specified in their email will receive it.\nBcc\u2019d or \u2018unknown\u2019 conversation participants\nWhen a participant in a conversation replies to an email and Bcc\u2019s someone who is not a participant of the conversation, when the Bcc\u2019d person replies we will split out their reply into a new conversation.\nThere are other similar scenarios, e.g. when a teammate uses multiple email addresses in their client, they may start a conversation from one address then switch to using another. When they do this we would also split out their reply into a new conversation.\nWe will thread replies from Bcc\u2019d people (or other \u2018unknown\u2019 senders) into the same conversation. Their reply will contain a warning banner to tell the teammate that the person wasn\u2019t previously seen in the conversation, and they were not CC\u2019d by another participant.\nThe sender will be added as a participant into the conversation. The teammate can choose to remove them from the conversation if they don\u2019t want that person to see their replies.\nGroup conversations with one participant on Messenger\nMessenger conversations can also become group conversations. Only one of the participants can access the conversation in the Messenger; all other participants only receive replies by email.\nWhen the Messenger teammate sends a reply through the Messenger, all participants will receive it.\nFor customers replying, they will reply to the n+u address which means their reply will be added to the Messenger for the Messenger user to see, and forwarded on to the other email participants.\nIt\u2019s still the case that Messenger conversations can also become group conversations, and that only one of the participants can access the conversation in the Messenger; all other participants only receive replies by email.\nIt\u2019s also still the case that when the Messenger user replies, all participants will get the message, but the email will look like this:\nsam.murray.onchat@examply.intercom-mail.com\nto represent the Messenger teammate better. The email will also contain a call-out at the top to inform participants that replying to the email will send it to the user who is on the Messenger.\nConversation history\nCustomers have a setting in their Email settings to determine whether or not the full history of a conversation should be appended to the bottom of each email sent in a conversation.\nSending conversation history in emails can be\nenabled or disabled\n.\nUser replies from the API\nThe API can be used to add email replies to conversation on behalf of users. This triggers the reply to be sent to all participants in the conversation.\nBehavior remains unchanged.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSending email notifications without conversation content or history\nStart a conversation from the Inbox\nManage group conversations in the Inbox\nDetect customers in forwarded emails\nConfigure your email channel to support multiple brands"},

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9929230-the-fin-ai-engine", "title": "The Fin AI Engine\u2122", "content": "The Fin AI Engine\u2122 allows Fin AI Agent to refine every query, optimize every response and validate the quality of each answer. As a result, it's the only AI agent that can balance industry-high resolutions with industry-low hallucinations.\nMany AI agents can optimize toward either high resolutions or low hallucinations, but struggle with doing both. This is because they often simply apply a \u2018wrapper\u2019 to a generative Large Language Model (LLM), instead of building on top of it, because it\u2019s cheaper and easier.\nHowever, this approach ignores the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate and expose your customers to incorrect or irrelevant information. Without a system like Intercom's that refines the LMM\u2019s inputs and outputs, an AI agent cannot be effectively optimized for accuracy and reliability.\nHow it works\nPhase 1 - Refine query\nIn order to optimize the accuracy of an answer that an LLM generates, the inputs the LLM receives must be refined for comprehension. The clearer and more understandable the query, the better the output.\nOften in customer service, customers can write in to support without fully explaining or contextualizing their query. To solve this problem, the Fin AI Engine\u2122 has been designed to refine the inputs that are sent to the LLM. This ensures that each customer message is optimized in terms of its meaning and context so that the LLM has the best possible chance of producing an accurate answer.\nIn addition, the Fin AI Engine\u2122 performs checks to see whether a Workflows automation or Custom Answer should be triggered based on the topic and context of a customer's query, as well as performing safety checks to filter out anything that Fin shouldn\u2019t be answering.\nCheck for safety and relevance\nThe AI engine performs a comprehensive check of a customer query, in order to filter for anything that Fin shouldn\u2019t be answering such as requests for confidential information, irrelevant questions, malicious actors, data harvesting and more.\nOptimize query comprehension\nThe AI engine optimizes the customer message to make it more searchable and easy to understand for the LLM. The AI engine performs many checks, and executes the correct optimization based on whether the query intent and topic is clear, if the query needs to be reworded, and much more.\nCheck for Workflows automation\nThe customer\u2019s message is checked for the presence of any pre-configured conditions which trigger a specific automation (such as a complaint).\nCheck for Custom Answer\nAn additional check is performed to detect whether a pre-configured Custom Answer is needed for the customer query.\nPhase 2 - Generate response\nOnce a query has been checked and optimized the next stage is to generate a response using the LLM. For this task, the Fin AI Engine\u2122 has been designed to use a bespoke and enhanced retrieval augmented generation architecture (RAG for short).\nRAG is a process that involves retrieving relevant information from a data source and combining it with a user's prompt before passing it to an LLM. This additional context helps improve the model's output by enhancing its base knowledge, and in doing so reducing the risk of inaccuracies like hallucinations.\nIntercom\u2019s application of RAG is highly unique. The AI group at Intercom has invested heavily in optimizing our unique application of RAG and continuously tests both the accuracy of the LLM and the individual steps of RAG to improve overall performance.\nOptimize retrieval:\nThe AI engine searches the available information, actions, or data and determines what is most relevant to the nature of the query and what is needed to solve the question or problem. Information sources include:\nContent\n- such as past Intercom conversations, help center articles, PDFs, and HTML/URLs that have been approved as accurate and safe sources.\nData\n- internal or external to Intercom, including dynamic information that Fin can use to personalize the customer experience.\nIntegrations & actions\n- determine whether any actions will be necessary on third party systems as a result of the customer queries intent.\nIntegrate and augment\nThe retrieved information is then integrated and augmented with the optimized query or \u2018input\u2019. This step ensures that the generative model has access to the most relevant and up-to-date information before producing a response. The augmented input is structured in a way that maintains the context and relevance of the retrieved information, making it easier for the model to understand and use.\nGenerate response\nClarify and disambiguate\nIf the output from the model doesn\u2019t meet the Fin AI Engine\u2122 parameters for certainty, then a response is generated to ask the customer to clarify their query. This disambiguation step helps avoid risks like hallucinations as the response generated is contextual and grounded in the facts from your company\u2019s available knowledge resources and support content.\nTake an action\nIf an action is required as a product of the user query and intent, the action will be performed using the necessary information, data, integrations and systems.\nGenerate answer\nThe generative model uses the augmented input to generate an answer. By incorporating the retrieved information, the model can produce more accurate, contextually relevant, and detailed responses. The generated answer may undergo post-processing to ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with the user's query.\nPhase 3 - Validate accuracy\nIn the final step of the process, the Fin AI Engine\u2122 performs checks to understand whether the output from the LLM meets the necessary response accuracy and safety standards. Many checks are performed, covering whether there is enough confidence in the response, the response is accurate enough, and whether the response is grounded enough in reality to address the question adequately.\nValidate the response\nCompare the generated response to the original customer query.\nDetermine if the generated response answers the query well enough.\nDetermine if the generated response is grounded in the knowledge of your knowledge resources and support content as a source of truth.\nRespond to customer\nSend the generated response back to the customer through Fin.\nEngine optimization\nTo calibrate and enhance engine performance, the Fin AI Engine\u2122 has advanced integrated tools that help optimize answer generation, efficiency, precision, and coverage.\nFin customization and control\n- Intercom has incorporated features and tools designed to help users customize and control how Fin responds, what it can do, what information it can use and much more. Each of these pieces plays a part in how well Fin performs. The more it knows how to do, the more it can do, and the more you will be able to automate your support with human-quality customer experiences.\nAI analytics and reporting\n- The Fin AI Engine\u2122 has been designed to facilitate analyses on the effectiveness of each stage of the answer generation process. This gives the AI group at Intercom the tools they need to improve each stage of the process and overall performance. A rigorous amount of testing happens before any changes are made to the AI engine architecture, which takes into account how each small change impacts the engine as a whole. In addition, the AI engine offers Intercom users access to pre-built and customizable reports that help to understand where Fin is working well, and what can be improved.\nAI recommendations\n- the AI engine offers recommendations to continuously improve performance over time. This ranges from identifying which content could help fill gaps in Fin\u2019s knowledge, to highlighting underperforming content that should be further optimized, or suggesting actions should be set up to help Fin can resolve more queries for customers.\nSafety and security\nRelying exclusively on the generative capabilities of an LLM to answer or solve a customer problem is not a reliable way to serve customers. Without the proper safeguards in place, LLMs can be open to manipulation or hallucinations, which could then impact your customers. To ensure safety and reliability, Fin AI Engine\u2122 has been designed with strict safety controls at each stage. If the necessary parameters for safety have not been met at any of the steps or stages, Fin will let the customer know that it cannot answer the query and escalate to human support.\nIntercom has implemented state-of-the-art security measures to protect Fin against a wide range of LLM threats, including those identified by the OWASP LLM Top 10. By consistently testing a variety of high-end LLMs, and deploying rigorous internal controls, security protocols, and safeguards, Fin is able to achieve the highest level of security and reliability while avoiding potential limitations and threats.\nThat means you and your customers can always trust Fin\u2019s answers as the safest, most accurate, and reliable of any AI agent.\nLearn more about Fin\u2019s safety measures on\ntrust.intercom.com\n.\nFin AI Security\nComprehensive overview of the security measures and testing protocols implemented for Intercom\u2019s Fin AI features available\nhere\n.\nRegional hosting\nFin AI Agent is available on US,\nEU and AU hosted workspaces\n.\nCompliance\nIntercom has international accreditations and controls in place in order to ensure the highest standard of safety and security, including:\nISO 27001, ISO27701, ISO 27018 and ISO42001\nHIPAA compliance.\nSOC 2 Report - SOC 2, Type II audit report covering controls specific to security, availability and confidentiality.\nHDS certificate - Certification of compliance with the HDS Referential Version 1.1 (English and French version)\nPenetration test summary - Summary of detailed penetration tests on Intercom\u2019s application and infrastructure by third-party security experts.\nCloud security alliance assessment - Security and privacy self-assessments based off of the Cloud Controls Matrix and the CSA Code of Conduct for GDPR Compliance.\nThird-party LLM data usage, transfer and storage\nCustomer data is not used for model training by LLM providers.

Fin's answers are derived from your enabled support content, so\noptimizing this content\nis the best way to improve Fin's performance.\nWhile Fin has a\nvery low hallucination rate (<1%)\n, if you believe an answer is not related to your content, you can notify our Support team so we can report this feedback (simply start a conversation in the Messenger and request to talk to our team. We\u2019re always eager to improve Fin and appreciate any feedback on irregularities or unexpected behavior.\nCan I associate the customer's question asked with a different/better article than the one Fin used?\nFin formulates AI answers based on the content sources, data, and guidance you've provided. We recommend\ncreating more relevant and specific content\nfor Fin to match the correct content with customer queries.\nTip:\nTry using\nsnippets\nto phrase customer queries multiple ways and provide the same answer.\nCan you edit/influence the clarifying questions that Fin AI Agent asks?\nClarifying questions from Fin AI Agent are built into the AI conversation experience and cannot be edited.\nIf you ask Fin AI Agent the same question twice, why does the answer vary?\nIf you ask the same question twice to the Fin AI Agent and receive different answers, it's because the system uses a variety of AI models and language learning technology that may call on different sources at different times. This is designed to reduce latency and improve accuracy, but can result in varying answers due to the dynamic nature of the AI's decision-making process.\nDoes Fin AI Agent learn from customer interactions?\nThe Fin AI Agent can learn from interactions that have been successfully resolved without the need to escalate to a human teammate.\nIf customers are generally satisfied with an AI-provided answer, Fin is likely to use that answer in future conversations, as it employs machine learning to improve over time.\nWhile Fin learns from successful interactions\nover time\n, it doesn\u2019t retain memory within a single conversation. To improve Fin\u2019s performance in future conversations, use the\nOptimize dashboard\nto identify what\u2019s going unresolved by Fin and get AI-generated suggestions for improvement.\nCan I reassign a conversation to Fin in the Inbox?\nIt's not possible to reassign a conversation to Fin from a teammate inbox, however, a teammate can get Fin involved by triggering a reusable workflow:\nSet up a reusable workflow\nwith a \"Let Fin answer\" step.\nTrigger the reusable workflow\nfrom a conversation in the inbox to get Fin involved.\nThe customer can then reply with their question and then Fin will attempt to answer.\nCustomer Experience\nWhat are Fin's capabilities as a chatbot?\nFin AI Agent is more than a chatbot: using the most sophisticated AI language models, it instantly generates answers to resolve customer issues and questions across multiple channels (including chat and email). Fin can engage in customer conversations and offer support through conversational answers based solely on your support content.\nCan Fin detect when a customer needs human support and escalate automatically?\nYes! You can set\nescalation rules\nin\nFin > Train > Guidance\nso Fin automatically transfers sensitive topics (e.g., refunds, cancellations, sensitive data etc.) to a human agent if you prefer. Learn more about using\nFin Guidance\n.\nCan Fin generate a summary of conversation history for a customer?\nYes, Fin AI Agent will provide a summary if a customer requests a transcript of their conversation history.\nDoes Fin AI Agent respect audience targeting on Intercom Articles?\nYes, Fin AI Agent answers questions based on the articles that the customer on Messenger has access to see using\naudience targeting\n. So it won't answer questions using private or restricted articles that a customer has no access to.\nWhat happens if Fin AI Agent can't find an answer using the content available?\nWhen Fin AI Agent doesn\u2019t find a clear or confident answer using your available\nknowledge sources\n, Fin AI Agent will deliver a disambiguation response to the customer which will typically:\nGive context of sources that were found.\nExpress uncertainty.\nAttempt to answer if possible.\nRequest clarification from the user.\nHow easy is it for Fin AI Agent to find the answer?\nIf a user doesn\u2019t use\ncorrect\nterminology, the likelihood that Fin AI Agent will answer in \u201cshort answer\u201d format (as opposed to sharing a number of possible articles) drops off significantly, but the articles shared will generally be helpful and relevant.\nThe longer and more complex a user\u2019s initial request, the less likely that Fin AI Agent will nail a response. For example, \u201c\nHow to set up a series\n\u201d\nis better\nthan something like \u201c\nThe user incorrectly received a welcome email from a series. The email referenced an incorrect admin username. The email to the customer is not actually coming from the series. We proved this by pausing the series, replicated the steps, and received the email. Can you please help me figure out where the email was sent from and why\u201d.\nFin AI Agent doesn\u2019t process one-word replies very effectively, mostly due to lack of context.\nA user sending many quick questions/replies in a row without giving Fin AI Agent a chance to respond, will only get an answer to their most recent reply.\nHow can I make Fin AI Agent use hyperlinks from Articles and Snippets without spelling out the URL directly in the source?\nCurrently, Fin AI Agent is not able to present links in consistently formatted hyperlinks. You can use\nGuidance\nto encourage Fin to hyperlink where possible, but this will still depend on which sources were initially retrieved by Fin when forming an AI answer.\nWhat if there is an outage that affects Fin AI Agent use?\nWhen something goes wrong on our end trying to get a Fin AI Agent response in a conversation, we will send a message in the conversation that says \"\nOops, something went wrong. I'll route you to the team.\n\" Right after that Fin will proceed with the handover process (just like when end-users ask to get more help or talk to a person).\nAI Technology\nWhat is the difference between Fin AI Agent and Copilot?\nFin is an AI agent for your customers, and Copilot is an AI assistant for your teammates in the Inbox.\nFin AI Agent\nis the first AI agent that delivers human-quality customer service. It can handle your entire frontline support because it learns, behaves, answers and improves just like the best human agents do. You can now scale your support without scaling your team, and free your human team to do higher impact work.\nCopilot\nis a personal AI assistant designed to improve the efficiency of support agents in the inbox by providing them with instant, expert answers drawn from your team's internal and external support content, including past conversations.\nHow does Fin AI Agent answer customer questions?\nFin AI Agent uses\nIntercom\u2019s patented AI Engine\nto understand the customer question, search for relevant answers in your\nsupport content\nand\ndata\n, and provide accurate answers to customers based on those sources.\nHow can I trust the accuracy of Fin AI Agent, what's preventing it from hallucinating?\nThe\nFin AI Engine\n\u2122 allows Fin to refine every query, optimize every response and validate the quality of each answer. As a result, it's the only AI agent that balances industry-high resolutions with industry-low hallucinations.\nHere are the safeguards that we put in place to ensure that your AI Agent provides the most accurate answers:\nIt only provides answers based on your\nsupport content\nor\ndata\n.\nIt tries to disambiguate a question when it doesn\u2019t understand the customer question.\nWhen it does not know the answer, it will say that it didn\u2019t find an answer, and it can then hand over to a human.\nWe work hard to make sure the Fin AI Engine\u2122 performs with a high level of accuracy, however, the nature of current AI models means they may occasionally give an incorrect answer.\nLearn more about Fin AI safety and security\n.\nWhat happens if Anthropic has an outage?\nIf Anthropic is down, AI-generated answers from Fin AI Agent will not send.

These are automatically grouped by topic areas you can focus on to increase the number of resolved conversations.\nIf you haven\u2019t set Fin AI Agent live or Fin hasn't been involved in any conversations yet, you'll see an empty state on the\nContent gaps\ntab. Once Fin is involved in conversations, you'll start seeing data here.\nLearn how the data is generated\n.\nEach grouping is a cluster of similar questions asked by your users that were unresolved \u2014 that is, Fin AI Agent either didn\u2019t have an answer for the question, the user asked to be routed to the team, or the conversation was abandoned. The question group naming is created by AI and summarizes the questions in that particular group.\nYou can sort the list of unresolved question groups by:\nLanguage\n: language of the questions and conversations in the question group (this can be filtered).\nVolume\n: total number of conversations in a question group.\nAbandoned\n: number of conversations where Fin sent an answer, the customer gave negative feedback, and left the conversation.\nRouted to team\n: number of conversations where Fin gave an answer, but the customer asked to talk to the team.\nDeep dive into conversations\nClick into each question group to see a list of associated conversations open up in the side panel. Click on a specific question to open a new tab and look at that conversation in more detail and see the teammate's response. Their response will help you identify what information is currently missing from your content.\nFocus on the most specific question groups, e.g. \"Project duplication issues\" would help highlight specific issues customers are having with this feature, vs \"Task management\" which could be a broad area and involve more manual investigation to drill down into conversations and find content gaps.\nImproving your content\nEasily find related content Fin AI Agent has used in attempts to answer these questions and update existing content or add new content to improve how Fin answers this question in the future.\nTo see related content Fin AI Agent has used, click on a question group to open the side panel, then click on the\nRelated content\ntab. This will provide a list of sources Fin AI Agent used to try answer the questions in that group, including:\nContent type (article, snippet, etc.)\nFrequency (number of conversations in which this source was used)\nLast edited at (when this content was last updated by a teammate on your workspace)\nClicking on a content source will open the content in a new tab for you to edit.\nFrom the side panel you can also click on the\nAdd content\nbutton to create a new piece of content that answers the unresolved question.\nHow the data is generated\nWe analyze up to 10,000 conversations per week. If you have more conversations on a weekly basis, we will take a sample of your conversations to perform this analysis.\nFor example:\nIf you have 8,000 conversations in week 1, this will analyze 8,000 conversations. If in week 2, you have 12,000 conversations, the analysis will cover 10,000 conversations out of a total of 20,000. If in week 3 you have 5,000 conversations, the analysis will cover 10,000 out of 25,000 conversations, and so on.\nIf you have 1,000 conversations in week 1, and 500 conversations in week 2, and 3,000 conversations in week 3, and 500 conversations in week 4, at the end of week 4, an analysis will be done on all 5,000 conversations.\nNote:\nIf you haven\u2019t set Fin AI Agent live or Fin hasn't been involved in any conversations yet, you'll see an empty state on the\nContent gaps\ntab.\nOnce Fin is involved in conversations, you'll start seeing data here after the first week.\nYou'll need a minimum of 10 unresolved Fin conversations a month for insights to be generated. However, this is a baseline requirement, and insights depend on identifying meaningful clusters or patterns across these conversations, which may not always occur (even if you had 10 unresolved Fin conversations).\nConsider increasing the number of conversations Fin AI Agent gets involved in (Involvement Rate) in order to see insights sooner.\nData refresh frequency\nThe reporting data uses data for the conversations of the past 30 days, and gets refreshed and fully regenerated every week.

Read below to find out the top ten ways to optimize Fin and how to put them into practice.\n1. Track Fin's KPIs and performance funnel\nKeep a close eye on Fin's performance by going to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze > Performance\nwhere you'll see the KPIs you should keep track of, including:\nInvolvement rate\nResolution rate\nCustomer Experience (CX) Score\nThe\nPerformance funnel\nvisualizes how conversations flow through key stages when Fin is involved. It allows you to quickly understand Fin's coverage, success at resolving queries, and the customer experience\u2014all in a single, digestible view.\n2. Boost Fin's involvement rate\nThe\nInvolvement rate\nchart shows the percentage of your total conversations where Fin participated.\nYou can boost involvement rate by getting Fin involved in more conversations. Visit the\nTopics Explorer\nand select\nFin involvement rate\nto see AI automatically group your support conversations into topics and subtopics. This highlights specific topics where Fin's involvement is the weakest and needs improvement.\nViewing your support conversations by topics helps you to understand where you can make the most impactful improvements by filling content gaps and using Fin to handle more of these topics.\n3. Boost Fin's resolution rate\nThe\nResolution rate\nchart indicates how often Fin\u2019s answers lead to a resolution, offering insight into the overall health and accuracy of your support content and data.\nIf this rate is steadily increasing, you're on the right track. However, if you notice a decline, go to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze > Optimize\nto identify gaps and opportunities to improve Fin's resolution rate.\nThe\nOptimize dashboard\nbreaks conversations down into:\nContent gaps\n\u2013 Shows informational queries Fin couldn\u2019t resolve.\nData gaps\n\u2013 Shows personalized queries missing necessary data.\nAction gaps\n\u2013 Shows action-based queries requiring tasks or integrations.\nWhen you select each of these tabs, you'll be able to see AI-generated topics and the conversations which fall under them to understand where to fill content gaps, add missing data, or create new tasks to ensure Fin can answer next time and improve your resolution rate.\n4. Improve Fin's Customer Experience (CX) Score\nThe\nCX Score\nchart indicates how often Fin\u2019s answers lead to a positive or negative customer experience.\nLearn more about how CX Scores are calculated\n.\nGet a CX Score analysis by going to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze > Optimize\nand selecting the\nCX score\ntab at the top. This breaks conversations down into:\nNegative Fin CX\n\u2013 Review resolutions that received a negative CX Score and improve the Fin customer experience.\nPositive Fin CX\n\u2013 Review resolutions that received a positive CX Score to validate where Fin is doing well.\nIt's encouraging to see positive customer experiences with Fin, but you can often learn more from negative customer experiences. Drill-in to the\nNegative Fin CX\nto see AI-generated topics and the conversations which fall under them to identify where Fin's interactions went wrong and address the root cause.\n5. Take action with AI-generated suggestions\nView\nsuggestions\nfor clear, actionable steps to improve Fin. These are AI-generated by analyzing both:\nFailed Fin responses (e.g. escalations or poor-quality replies) and comparing them to successful human replies to similar questions, and\nTeammate handled responses and checking whether there are gaps in your knowledge base.\nSuggestions identify the likely root cause and recommend one or more actions to improve the topic:\nAdd new content\nEdit existing content\n6. Dive into Fin conversations in the inbox\nIn the Inbox, you can click\nImprove Answer\non any AI-generated response to review the content Fin used to create it.\nEven if the response successfully resolved the issue, you can enhance it by adding more information or clarity. This helps Fin perform better and deliver more accurate answers in the future.\n7. Foster a QA culture among your team\nConsider establishing a feedback loop that allows your support team to flag inaccuracies, suggest improvements, and request new content to address knowledge gaps.\nOne way to achieve this is by creating a dedicated\nBack-office ticket\ntype, enabling teammates to submit these requests directly from the inbox. If Fin provides an unhelpful answer, teammates can review the source and open a ticket to update the content without leaving the inbox or losing valuable time.\nAnother option is to ask your teammates to write snippets immediately to address content gaps or update information. Your knowledge manager or team can then review these snippets regularly, incorporating them into main articles and other resources.\nThese approaches not only streamline the process but also enable teammates to proactively contribute to improving content and Fin\u2019s performance.\n8. See content Fin uses which doesn't drive resolutions\nWithin the\nFin AI Agent report\n, you can view\ncontent performance\nand check the resolution rate of your content. The \"involved\" column shows how many times each piece of content was used by Fin. The \"resolved\" column shows how many times each piece of content has effectively answered customer questions.\nSort by Fin AI Agent involved conversations to identify the content referenced most frequently. If the number in the Fin AI Agent resolved conversations column is significantly lower for a piece of content, it means the information Fin is using is not providing satisfactory answers to customers.\nExamine the underperforming content for missing, inaccurate, or ambiguous information and revise where necessary, empowering Fin to tackle customer issues more effectively.\nLearn more about optimizing your content for Fin\n.\n9. Train Fin with Guidance on your support policies\nFin Guidance\nlets you train Fin to speak in your brand\u2019s voice, follow your policies, and handle conversations the way you want, including:\nCommunication style\nContext and clarification\nHandover and escalation\nAnd more\nThis means faster resolution times, more consistent support quality, and a better customer experience.\nYou can set clear rules for what Fin should say and do, from using the right terminology to escalating sensitive issues.\nBuilt-in reporting shows how well Fin is following your guidance, with AI-powered suggestions to help you fine-tune responses over time.\n10. Enable multilingual Fin\nIf you have a global customer base, allow Fin to provide support in 45 languages by enabling\nreal-time translation\n. This means Fin will instantly translate answers to match the customer's language using your existing support content \ud83d\ude2e\nYou can also sync/upload content in other languages, or\nadd translated versions of your public articles\nif you want Fin to use specific translations you provide.\nFin will first search for the answer using content that is available in the language a question was written in. For example, if a user writes their question in French, Fin will search for an answer in your available French content (i.e. articles, snippets, PDF files, etc).\nIf you have enabled\nReal-time translation\n, when Fin can\u2019t find relevant support content in the customer\u2019s language, it will translate existing content in another language (your chosen fallback language).\n\u200b\nFollow these tips to keep Fin optimized and drive positive results for teams, Fin, and customers alike. \ud83d\ude03\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nFin AI Agent explained\nFin AI Agent reporting\nDig into Fin AI Agent unresolved questions\nMonitor Fin\u2019s performance with clarity and confidence\nOptimize Fin instantly with the help of AI"},

As we move closer to the full release, we\u2019ll keep you updated on wider availability for EU/AU hosted workspaces.\nThe Topics Explorer currently only works for\nEnglish conversations\n. Support for conversations in other languages is coming soon.\nUnderstanding AI-powered topics and subtopics\nAI topics use machine learning to group conversations into topics (broad themes) and subtopics (highly specific, recurring issues).\nHow AI topics and subtopics are discovered\nThe system analyzes a large amount of historical conversation data\u2014specifically from the past 90 days. It looks for patterns in the questions customers ask, then groups similar conversations together.\nSubtopics\nare discovered first by clustering similar questions from past conversations.\nThese subtopics are then grouped into broader\ntopics\n.\nFinally, the system automatically generates clear topic titles to help you quickly understand each topic and subtopic.\nNote:\nTopics and subtopics are not based on predefined keywords. Any keywords shown in the product are only there to help explain what each topic is about.\nHow conversations are assigned to AI topics\nOnce topics and subtopics are discovered, the AI takes two steps:\nBackfilling:\nThis step involves identifying and organizing subtopics from past conversations (the last 90 days). Conversations are retroactively assigned to one or more discovered topics and subtopics.\nInference:\nThis step assigns new conversations to one or more of the previously discovered subtopics on a daily basis.\nConversation criteria for generating AI topics\nTo build accurate topics and subtopics, the system uses conversations that meet certain criteria:\nConversations must be in English.\nConversations must not be marked as spam.\nConversations must have at least two participants (for example, a customer and Fin or a teammate).\nEach conversation is summarized into up to three key questions, which are used to identify patterns and assign to a subtopic.\nAt least 15 questions or conversations are needed to form a meaningful subtopic.\nNote:\nIf your conversations are too varied, or if there isn\u2019t enough volume around a single theme, no topics may appear\u2014even if there are many conversations.\nOngoing updates to AI topics and subtopics\nTopics/subtopics are built to adapt:\nDaily updates ensure new conversations are categorized promptly.\nNew topics and subtopics are added as they emerge, without removing or changing the ones already discovered.\nSome conversations may not get assigned to any topic if they are too different, low quality (like spam), or don\u2019t meet the criteria.\nNote:\nIt\u2019s currently not possible to modify or edit the AI topics/subtopics that are shown for your conversations, but we\u2019re exploring ways of providing you with more control.\nWhy you may have many smaller topics\nIt\u2019s common to see a few large topics with lots of subtopics and conversations within them, and many smaller topics with only a few subtopics and conversations. That\u2019s because:\nSome topics come up frequently across customers, while others are highly specific or niche and don\u2019t fit well with existing clusters.\nThe system avoids combining unrelated subtopics just to form larger topics\u2014it focuses on natural groupings.\nNote:\nAI topics and subtopics do not:\nDetect spam\nAnalyze sentiment\nDetermine if a query is informational or requires action\nHow to use AI-powered topics and subtopics\nSupport leaders and teams can use AI topics to understand what\u2019s driving volume and how to prioritize efforts to optimize their support.\nSpotting topic trends\nTo view the Topics Explorer, go to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze > Topics Explorer\n. Here, you\u2019ll see two main sections:\nThe left side has a tree map of topics:\nThe\nsize\nof the box signals the\nvolume\nof conversations in that topic.\nThe\ncolor\nof the box is related to the\nmetric selected\n.\nIn light mode, the darker colors signal areas needing attention.

This enables you to make targeted improvements to the most impactful subtopics by addressing the root cause of the volume and poor CX.\nCatch problems early, before they escalate by monitoring changes in volume and key metrics over time to spot emerging issues and act before they grow. For example, the chart below shows a sudden spike in volume with negative CX Scores for the \u201cAccount locked\u201d topic. This could highlight a bug or unexpected issue that\u2019s preventing customers from accessing their account.\nHover over a topic/subtopic to see a description of what\u2019s included in that topic and\nview conversations.\nFrom the conversations view, you can quickly click through conversations to identify issues and use the CX Score to understand how they were resolved. You can also open a conversation in the inbox to reply to the customer directly.\nIdentifying areas to optimize\nThese topics also appear in the Fin\nOptimize dashboard\nto help you prioritize efforts in improving Fin across involvement rate, resolution rate, and customer experience.\nTip:\nStart with a topic that\u2019s driving a high volume of conversations with low CX Scores and\nreview the suggestions\nto improve Fin\u2019s performance.\nFiltering other reports\nYou can use the AI topics/subtopics to filter your other\nIntercom reports\ntoo. Simply add a filter for\nAI Topic\nor\nAI Subtopic\nto select specific topics you want to filter by.\nFAQs\nHow do new AI topics get generated, and will it recategorize existing conversations when this happens?\nNew topics are generated through machine learning analysis of historical conversation data from the past 90 days. Subtopics are identified first by clustering similar questions, then grouped into broader topics. Importantly,\nnew topics and subtopics are added without removing or changing existing ones\n.\nWhy do some conversations not have topics?\nSome conversations might not appear under any topic if they:\nAre too varied or don\u2019t have enough volume around a single theme.\nAre too different from existing topics.\nAre low quality (e.g., spam).\nDon\u2019t meet the criteria (e.g., must be in English and have at least two participants).\nIs there a way to search AI topics and subtopics?\nYes, you can filter other Intercom reports by\nAI Topic\nor\nAI Subtopic\n. This lets you search and narrow down data using specific topics identified by the AI.\nWhen will I start seeing AI topics/subtopics?\nYou\u2019ll begin to see topics/subtopics after\ndeploying Fin\n. Your workspace needs to have more than one\neligible conversation\n. However, even if your workspace meets these criteria, AI topics may not appear right away. Here\u2019s why:\nTopic generation is part of a pipeline that updates periodically. If your conversations qualify, they will be included in that pipeline.\nSome customers start seeing topics after just 30\u201350 conversations, while others may need more to generate a related topic.\nOnce your workspace accumulates enough qualifying conversations, topics will begin to appear automatically as the pipeline processes new data.\nWhy do my AI topics/subtopics change over time?\nTopics and subtopics are updated daily to include new conversations. As patterns evolve or new issues emerge, new topics are added, though existing ones remain unchanged. This ensures a live and accurate reflection of current support trends.\nWhat does the color size/scheme mean on the Topics Explorer tree map?\nSize\nof each box = volume of conversations.\nColor\nof each box = value of the selected performance metric (e.g., CX Score, resolution rate, etc).\nIn light mode: Darker colors indicate areas needing attention.\nIn dark mode: Lighter colors indicate areas needing attention.\nHow are AI topics/subtopics different from other topics in Intercom?\nAI topics/subtopics:\nAutomatically group your support conversations (no manual tagging or set up) to show what customers are asking, how those issues are impacting KPIs, and how to fix them.\nConversation topics\n:\nAllow you to organize conversations through defining relevant keywords and phrases your customers use to talk about a topic, and then constantly iterating to narrow or broaden the keywords to capture all conversations in the relevant topic.\nAI category detection [beta]\n:\nEnables Fin to automatically categorize conversations by topic, sentiment, or other chosen criteria that you define (not just topics).

This metric reflects Fin's coverage\u2014how much of your total conversation volume Fin is actively handling and attempting to resolve.\nResolution rate:\nThe percentage of conversations that Fin successfully resolves without needing to hand off to a human. This metric reflects Fin\u2019s effectiveness in fully resolving customer issues. A high resolution rate means Fin is reducing team workload while maintaining service quality.\nCustomer Experience (CX) score:\nThe percentage of positive customer ratings out of all ratings received for conversations handled exclusively by Fin, without any human agent involvement.

It follows the conversations that Fin was involved in and highlights how effectively Fin is resolving those conversations, as well as the quality of the customer experience. The sankey chart in the\nOverview report\nfocuses more on a\nholistic view\nof how all conversations flow from creation to resolution and who handles them on their journey (including teammates, Fin, and chatbots).\nWhere has Fin CSAT gone?\nFin CSAT is still available in the\nReports\nsection of the product, where you can add the Fin CSAT chart to any of your reports. The Performance dashboard is focused on\nCX Score\nto provide a more comprehensive view of customer experience across all conversations\u2014without relying solely on surveys, which typically offer limited coverage.\nWhere has the deflection rate gone?\nFin\u2019s deflection rate is still available in the\nReports\nsection of the product.

It gives support leaders and teams full visibility into customer sentiment, without relying on surveys.\nIn this article, you'll learn about the challenges the CX Score aims to solve, how to access and interpret your scores, and best practices to maximize its value.\nNote:\nThe CX Score is currently in open beta for US-hosted workspaces using Fin. As we move closer to the full release, we\u2019ll keep you updated on wider availability for EU/AU hosted workspaces.\nWhat challenges does the CX Score help solve?\nThe CX Score is helping support leaders and teams address the following issues:\nSurveyed CSAT is incomplete and biased\n- It captures feedback from a small, self-selecting group, often overrepresenting extreme opinions.\nCustomers score AI and human agents differently\n- Customers tend to score AI support more harshly, making it hard to assess AI fairly.\nDisengaged customers go unmeasured\n- Customers who don\u2019t respond to surveys - including those who had a neutral or frustrating experience - are often left out of satisfaction metrics.\nThere\u2019s no scalable way to measure satisfaction across all AI and human-led conversations\n- Without full coverage, teams struggle to track trends, identify friction points, and improve overall support quality.\nSurvey design can skew results\n- Small changes, like survey timing or phrasing, impact scores without support quality having changed.\nThe CX Score addresses these gaps by scoring every meaningful interaction\u2014without relying on surveys\u2014so support teams can get a fuller, more consistent view of customer sentiment across both Fin and teammate conversations.\nNote:\nThe CX Score is only available to customers who are using Fin -\ndeploy Fin to see your CX Score\nacross all conversations in any language.\nHow CX Score works\nThe CX Score uses machine learning to score every meaningful conversation. It analyzes signals like customer sentiment, resolution status, and service quality to predict whether the customer was satisfied.\nCustomer sentiment\n- looks at the tone and language the customer uses throughout the conversation to understand how they\u2019re feeling.\nResolution status\n- reflects whether the customer\u2019s questions or issues were clearly addressed, even if they didn\u2019t explicitly confirm it. The model evaluates all the issues raised during the conversation and assesses how many were resolved.\nService quality\n- considers how helpful, clear, and timely the responses were\u2014across both Fin and teammates. This includes tone, depth of knowledge, ability to resolve issues, and speed of response.\nThese signals are gathered across all three areas to generate a score ranging from 1 to 5, where 1\u20133 are considered negative and 4\u20135 are considered positive. The CX Score is then calculated as follows:\nNumber of positive CX Score ratings [4s and 5s] / Total number of CX Score ratings \u00d7 100.\nSpecific criteria for CX Score\nA conversation will receive a CX rating once all of the following conditions are met:\nThe conversation has been closed.\nIt includes at least 2 replies from the customer.\nIt includes at least 2 replies from Fin, teammates, or chatbots/workflows.\nThere is enough conclusive information in the conversation to determine a rating.\nThe conversation is over chat or email (not phone).\nThis gives you a consistent, objective view of customer satisfaction without relying on survey responses. To keep scores accurate, it automatically filters out spam.\nNote:\nIt can take a few hours for a conversation to be assigned a CX Score.\nHow to access your CX Score\nOverview report\nTo see your CX Score, go to\nReports > Overview\nand scroll down to find the \"CX Score\u201d section.\nThis includes:\nOverall CX Score\n- out of all conversations.\nFin AI Agent CX Score\n- conversations that were only handled by Fin.\nFin AI Agent and Teammate CX Score\n- where both Fin and a teammate participated in the same conversation.\nTeammate CX Score\n- conversations that were only handled by a teammate.\nCX Score over time\n- Shows the trend over time using the above metrics in a multi-metric line chart.\nHover over metrics and click\nDrill-in\nto see detailed explanations of why a certain score was assigned.\nNote:\nThe \u201cCustomer Satisfaction\u201d section on the Overview report has been renamed to \u201cSurveyed CSAT\u201d.\nAlthough CX Scores are calculated for both Fin and teammate conversations, you must be using Fin to view CX Scores across all conversations.\nTopics Explorer\nThe\nTopics Explorer\nallows you to track performance by topic, not just team. Each topic includes CX Score so you can see which issues are handled well and which need attention.\nFocus where it matters most by identifying high-volume, poor CX Score topics and click on them to see the tree map and line charts broken down by subtopics.

Click\nDrill-in\nto view the conversations behind Fin\u2019s CX Score, along with a summary that highlights key moments and explains why each score was given.\nFin AI Agent report template\nThe\nFin AI Agent report template\nhas been updated to include the\nFin AI Agent CX Score\nat the top and in the\nFin AI Agent\u2019s impact over time\nline chart.\nThe \u201cFin AI Agent CX Score\u201d section of this template gives you a complete overview of:\nFin AI Agent CX Score\nFin AI Agent conversations with a CX Score rating\nFin AI Agent CX Score ratings\nFin AI Agent CX Score ratings - by time\nThis includes a table view of individual conversation ratings and explanations.\nNote:\nThe Fin AI CSAT charts have been removed from this template. You can add them back by dragging them onto your report from the chart library.\nThese updates only apply to the template and will only affect customers who haven\u2019t previously made edits to the Fin AI Agent report in their workspace.\nCustom reports\nThe following metrics have been added to the\nConversations dataset\nand can be used to build your own reports:\nMetric\nDefinition\nCX Score\nThe percentage of conversations that received a positive CX Score rating (a score of 4 or 5) out of all conversations that were assigned a CX Score rating.\nConversations with any CX Score rating\nThe total number of conversations that have a CX Score rating.\nConversations with positive CX Score rating\nThe number of conversations that received a positive CX Score rating (a score of 4 or 5).\nNote:\nEach of these metrics has also two versions with a different timestamp:\nConversations started at\nConversation last closed at\nWe\u2019ve also added new attributes to Intercom reporting:\nCX Score\nrating\n: This is the rating from 1 (negative) - 5 (positive).\nCX Score rating explanation\n: Once a conversation is given a CX rating, it is also given a summary as to why the rating was given.\nTip:\nThese attributes are available in reports, the Inbox, and via the conversations API.\nYou can segment or filter CX metrics in your reports by the \u201cAgent Type\u201d attribute to understand how different participants are performing.\nFor example:\nTo see the CX Score for conversations handled only by human agents, filter by\nAgent Type\nis\nTeammate\n.\nTo view how Fin is performing, filter by\nAgent Type\nis\nFin\n.\nGetting the most from your CX Score\nTo maximize the value of your CX Score, we recommend the following:\nAction\nWhat to check\nTrack trends and patterns\nAre scores improving or declining after changes in support content, workflows, or product updates?\nDo certain categories (e.g., AI Agent vs. Teammate) perform better over time?\nInvestigate low-scoring conversations\nAre common themes emerging in low-rated interactions?\nAre customers dissatisfied with specific responses or resolution times?\nExplore AI-generated explanations\nWhat were the main concerns, resolution status, and sentiment for specific interactions?\nAre there common friction points affecting satisfaction?\nFAQs\nHow is the CX Score different from CSAT?\nTraditional CSAT surveys offer a narrow and often biased view of customer satisfaction. Response rates are low, feedback tends to reflect only extreme experiences, and AI support is often rated more harshly than human-led conversations.\nThe CX Score addresses these gaps by scoring every meaningful interaction\u2014without relying on surveys\u2014so support teams can get a fuller, more consistent view of customer sentiment across both Fin and teammate conversations.\nHow do I see my CX Score?\nTo view your CX Score, go to\nReports > Overview\n, then scroll down to find the \"CX Score\u201d section. You can also view Fin\u2019s CX score in the Fin AI Agent report template, Performance dashboard, or build your own custom reports using CX Score metrics and attributes.\nNote:\nAlthough CX Scores are calculated for both Fin and teammate conversations, you must be using Fin on your workspace before you can view CX Scores.\nIt can take a few hours for a conversation to be assigned a CX Score.\nHow far are conversations backfilled for the CX Score?\nWe backfilled 28 days of your conversations using the \"last closed at\" timestamp.\nI don\u2019t agree with some of the CX Scores. What can I do?\nJust like with CSAT, if you believe a CX Score isn\u2019t accurate or shouldn\u2019t be counted, you can\ntag the conversation\n(e.g., with \u201cexclude_from_cx\u201d). Then, use that tag to filter out those conversations in your reports.\nWhat happened to the Fin CSAT charts in the Fin report?\nWe have replaced Fin CSAT with the CX Score in the Fin AI Agent report template. If you'd like to continue using Fin CSAT, go to the chart library when editing a report. From there, you can add the old CSAT charts back in.\nCan CX Score be used to measure individual teammate performance?\nYes, CX Score can help assess individual teammate performance, especially when a teammate handles the entire conversation from start to finish. In these cases, the rating can reasonably be attributed to that teammate\u2019s work. However, in conversations involving multiple participants (e.g., Fin starts the conversation and a teammate finishes it), the CX Score reflects the overall customer experience rather than individual contributions.\nIt's also worth noting that surveyed CSAT wasn\u2019t perfect for agent-level attribution. The CSAT survey typically goes to the customer at the end of the conversation and is worded as feedback on the last person involved. However, customers may be rating the entire experience\u2014including Fin and earlier agents who responded to the conversation.\nHow do I measure CX at the individual teammate level?\nTo assess CX for individual teammates, use the \u201cTeammate Replied To\u201d attribute in your filters or segments. This includes any conversation where the selected teammate sent at least one reply to the customer\u2014even if other participants (like Fin or other teammates) were also involved.\nWhy can\u2019t I filter by CX rating on some charts and reports?\nCX rating and explanation attributes are only available on metrics that are derived from our\nConversations dataset\n. If you're working with metrics outside that dataset, the CX attributes won\u2019t be available for filtering or segmentation.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHolistic overview report\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nImproving your customer experience\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT) reporting\nMonitor Fin\u2019s performance with clarity and confidence"},

You can add Fin to an existing workflow, or create a new one. The best workflow triggers to use with Fin are:\nWhen customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\n- use this if you want Fin to immediately introduce itself in the Messenger and respond to customers' questions.\nWhen customer sends their first message\n- use this if you want Fin to respond to customers' questions across alternative channels (WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, etc.)\nChoose which workflow channels Fin is enabled on\nTo enable Fin on particular channels or for a specific audience, click on the workflow trigger settings (first block in the Workflows builder).\nIf you're creating a workflow for email, you can add audience rules\nusing email predicates\n.\nNote:\nChannel selection is only available when using triggers such as \"When customer sends their first message\" or \"When customer sends any message\".\nWhen adding Fin to email workflows, you must use the \"When customer sends their first message\" trigger or choose the \"Use Fin AI Agent over Email\" template if you're building a new workflow.\nAdd Let Fin answer step\nThen add Fin to your workflow by creating a path and selecting\nLet Fin answer\n. This inserts a\nLet Fin answer\nstep which can then be configured to control the behavior and handover.\nNot all Workflow steps are available over email. Check\nwhat actions are compatible with this channel\n. For this reason, we recommend creating a separate workflow solely for using Fin over email.\nThe\nLet Fin answer\nstep will trigger an answer\nafter\na customer has sent a message in the conversation. If you would like a reply button selection to lead to a\nLet Fin answer\nstep, you can add a message action prompting your customer to ask a question.\nYour workspace\noffice hours\nwill always be respected when Fin does a handover from a workflow.\nCreate difference experiences for different audiences\nBy using\nbranching\n, you can create different Fin AI Agent experiences for different audiences.\nFor example, for paying customers, you might want to hand over to a teammate when Fin can't answer but for non-paying customers, you might want to direct them to your Help Center.\nFor greater flexibility with email workflows, use the\n\u201cEmail to\", \"Email cc\", and \"Email Bcc\" predicates\nif you would like to create different auto-reply messages (and other steps and actions) depending on the email address a customer sends their message to.\nCustomize Fin's behavior in a Workflow\nTo customize Fin's behavior in a workflow, click on the\nLet Fin answer\nstep in the workflow path.\nSettings for chat only\nSet expectation for human support\nFor chat conversations, if you don't want Fin to hand over to a teammate, you can configure the step to not set any expectations for human support.\nAny messages you add to a workflow with Fin over email will be sent as one email. This also applies to any messages you've configured to be sent as follow-up messages when a customer goes inactive in a Fin conversation.\nAsk for more information before handover\nFor chat conversations, you can ask Fin to gather more information from a customer before passing to your team:\nClick on the\nLet Fin answer\nstep in your workflow.\nSelect\nAsk for more information before handover\n.\nEnable \"Collect more information when a customer asks to speak to the team\".\nFin will encourage the user to share more information. The exact message it sends will be similar to \"\nSure! While I connect you, could you provide us with more details about your issue to help us find an answer faster?\n\" This will be adapted to the context of the conversation and your workspace\u2019s Fin personality settings.\nBy prompting the customer for more context before Fin hands over to a teammate, there is another opportunity to get more and/or better information than presented the first time around. The benefit to this is two-fold:\nGives Fin another chance to answer: often customers don\u2019t give the AI Agent a chance, asking to speak to a human before asking Fin a question.\nIf context is provided, even if Fin can\u2019t provide an answer, the teammate will spend less time gathering context and will be able to troubleshoot faster.\nWe've tested this feature extensively at Intercom and observed an increase in answer rate, confirmed resolutions, and CSAT.\nNote:\nIf the customer doesn't reply to Fin's prompt for more information, or if Fin is unable to find an answer to a new query, the conversation will be automatically routed to the team (this will not count as a resolution).\nIf Fin does find an answer to a new query, then it will only route them to the team if the customer's reply indicates they still need help. If the customer replies they got the help they needed, the conversation will be regarded as a confirmed resolution, and if they abandon, as an assumed resolution.\nSettings for all channels (including email)\nAsk for conversation rating (CSAT)\nAt the end of a customer's interaction with Fin AI Agent you can ask them to give a conversation rating by toggling these settings on:\n\ud83d\udc4d Send CSAT if customer gives positive feedback\n\u23f3 Send CSAT if the customer becomes inactive after Fin showed an answer\nLearn more about Fin AI Agent CSAT\n.\nAuto-close abandoned Fin conversations\nChoose when to auto-close conversations by specifying a length of time Fin should wait before closing conversations.\nSelect if you want Fin to automatically\nclose the conversation after customer becomes inactive\n:\nIf Fin has answered the question, and/or\nIf Fin was not able to answer the question, and/or\nIf the customer left before asking any questions.\nYou can also\nCustomize what Fin says when closing the conversation\nto make sure the customer got what they needed and remind them they can still speak to your support team, even if the conversation is being closed.\nWhen you've finished configuring the\nLet Fin answer\nstep in your workflow, click\nDone\nto return to the workflow builder and finish building the full customer experience.\nConfigure Fin AI Agent handover\nFin AI Agent will attempt to answer questions posed by customers. If the customer gives positive feedback, Fin AI Agent will close the conversation and mark it as resolved.\nThis doesn't prevent the customer asking follow up questions.\nIf the customer gives negative feedback they will follow a handover path that you will need to configure in the workflow.\nIf a customer sends a message similar to \"talk to a person\" as their first message when Fin is triggered, Fin will follow the handover path without trying to generate a response.\nFor example, you could set expectations for when your team will reply or collect additional information that will help route the conversation to the right team. This helps make the transition as smooth as possible and can save teammates' time and effort when picking up the conversation.\nPass to a reusable workflow\nYou can also\npass to a reusable workflow\nif you have a common triage or data collection process that you want it to follow. Use the\nPass to a reusable workflow\nstep to hand Fin over to another workflow.\nThe\nreusable Workflow\nmust be created before you can set this up.\nPreview a Fin workflow\nWhen you add Fin to a workflow, you'll be able to experience a conversation with Fin using your workflow.\nFirst\nSave\nyour new workflow, then click the\nPreview\nbutton at the top of the Workflows builder.\nThis will give you an interactive preview of the Messenger experience when talking to Fin. Simply start asking questions you would expect to find answers to in the support content you added.\nIf you want to test a Fin workflow over email, send an email to your support email address configured to receive email in Intercom or to the email address in\nSettings > Email > Email forwarding\n.\nYou can also preview Fin from any website where you have the Messenger installed. Click\nPreview from a website\nand enter the address, then click\nOpen website\nto load the Messenger with Fin on that website.\nTo preview Fin AI Agent from a website, it'll need to be set live and you must have the\nMessenger installed\n.\nConflicts with existing Workflows\nIf you are using other Workflows alongside Fin AI Agent, there are 2 triggers where they could conflict with each other.\n1. Customer sends their first message\nFin AI Agent always takes priority and Workflows won't trigger. However, Fin can still be set up to pass to this Workflow.\n2. Customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\nWorkflow will be shown with reply buttons. Clicking on a reply button means entering the Workflow and Fin AI Agent will not fire.\nIf you leave the composer open (\nLet customer type\n), customers can still type in their question and Fin AI Agent will take over (Workflow will be skipped).\nHowever, if you disable the composer at the start of the Workflow, Fin will be blocked.\nIf this happens, here are some troubleshooting tips to try:\nEnable\nLet customer type\noption at the start of the Workflow, to ensure customers have the option of typing a message (and Fin will respond).\nUse the\nLet Fin answer\nstep later in the Workflow, preferably after a button says \u2018Ask a question\u2019.\nEnsure the audience targeting for workflows with Fin don't overlap with other workflows.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCustomize Fin AI Agent in the Messenger\nLet Fin AI Agent follow up after Outbound messages or Workflows\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over email\nCustomize Fin AI Agent's personality"},

For example, provide a contact number or link to another resource.\nThen click\nSave\nand move to the next step.\nStep 7: Auto-close abandoned Fin conversations\nChoose when to auto-close conversations by specifying a length of time Fin should wait before closing conversations.\nSelect if you want Fin to automatically\nclose the conversation after customer becomes inactive\n:\nIf Fin has answered the question, and/or\nIf Fin was not able to answer the question or the customer left before asking any questions.\nYou can also\nCustomize what Fin says when closing the conversation\nto make sure the customer got what they needed and remind them they can still speak to your support team, even if the conversation is being closed. Then click\nSave\nand move to the next step.\nStep 8: Ask for conversation rating (CSAT)\nAt the end of a customer's interaction with Fin AI Agent you can ask them to give a conversation rating by toggling these settings on:\n\ud83d\udc4d Send CSAT when the customer replies with a positive message (ie. 'That helped, thanks')\n\u23f3 Send CSAT if the customer becomes inactive after Fin showed an answer\nLearn more about Fin AI Agent CSAT\n.\nStep 9: Preview Fin over chat\nTo preview Fin over chat before setting it live:\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Deploy > Chat\n.\nUse the interactive Messenger preview on the right to start typing questions you think Fin should be able to answer from the content you've enabled.\nOnce you've previewed the experience, you can set Fin live.\nNote:\nTo preview Fin AI Agent the Messenger must be\ninstalled on web\n.\nYou\nwon't\nbe charged for conversations generated through this preview.\nPreviewing Fin always creates a test user called \"Preview User\" in your inbox. Currently, there's no way to deactivate the creation of these conversations in preview mode. To avoid creating new inbox conversations, use\nFin Testing\ninstead.\nThe preview will follow any handover setup you've configured if Fin can't resolve the conversation (i.e. routing to a team inbox).\nConversations created via the Fin preview won't be closed and will remain open even if you have a close action that should be applied.\nThe preview won't send a CSAT survey at the end of your conversation.\nWhile the preview doesn't require Fin to be set live, it still requires the content to be\navailable to Fin\n.\nThe preview doesn't respect content audience targeting.\nThe preview will always use the default brand and the Help Center associated with it. If you have a different Help Center associated with another Messenger brand it will still show as the default brand.\nStep 10: Review and set live\nOnce you've finished configuring Fin's chat experience, click\nSet Fin Live \ud83c\udf89\nYou'll need billing\npermissions\nto set Fin live if the T&Cs haven't been accepted yet. Accepting these terms is mandatory to be able to use Fin AI Agent.\nAdvanced setup through Workflows\nIf you want to add Fin to a workflow, or customize Fin in an existing workflow, go to\nFin AI Agent > Deploy > Chat\nand open\nAdvanced setup through Workflows\n.\nIf you used the \"Simple deploy\" to do some initial testing, we advise that you select\nPause Fin\nto prevent this from triggering before your live Workflows.\nIf you have an existing workflow set up specifically for inbound conversations through the Messenger or other chat channels:\nYou can simply edit the workflow add the \"Let Fin answer\" step, where appropriate.\nCustomize Fin's behavior\nin the workflow such as setting expectations, handovers, and closing abandoned conversations by clicking on \"Let Fin answer\".\nWhen you add Fin to your existing workflows, you'll find these under\nFin AI Agent > Workflows\nif you filter by \"Type is Using Fin\".\nIf you don't have a workflow set up specifically for inbound conversations through the Messenger or other chat channels:\nWe recommend you create one using the \"When customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\" or \"When customer sends their first message\" trigger.\nYou can ensure a workflow is only enabled for chat channels in the\ntrigger settings\n.\nAdd Fin to your workflow\nby creating a path and selecting\nLet Fin answer\n.\nCustomize Fin's behavior in your workflow\nTo\ncustomize Fin's behavior in a workflow\n, open your workflow and click on the\nLet Fin answer\nstep. Here, you can:\nSet expectations for human support.\nControl the answer type.\nAsk for more information before handing over to a teammate.\nAsk for conversation rating (Fin CSAT).\nAuto-close abandoned conversations.\nCustomize what Fin says when closing conversations.\nHave Fin respond to a specific audience\nBy using\nbranching\n, you can create different Fin experiences for different audiences.\nFor example:\nFor paying customers, you might want to hand over to a teammate when Fin can't answer but for non-paying customers, you might want to direct them to your Help Center.\nSee additional ways and examples of\nhow you can target specific audiences or customers\n.\nAdd as many branches as you need to create different experiences for your different customers.\nWhile you can also determine\naudience rules within the workflow trigger settings\n, we recommend only doing this if you have an additional workflow to cover everyone who\ndoesn't\nmatch those rules.\nHave Fin respond to a specific topic\nYou can also use\nbranching\nto create different Fin experiences and paths based on your different conversation topics.\nClick\nAdd step\nto start creating your branching logic.\nThen select\nBranches\nunder \"Proceed to another path\".\nOnce you\u2019ve added a branch, click on\nMissing condition\nto open up your branch settings.\nClick\n+ Add condition\nto set different conditions, e.g. if you want to route conversations based on a keyword in the message, select \"Message Content\" as a condition.\nYou can repeat this step to add multiple branches per keyword.\nOnce you\u2019ve defined your branches, click on the arrow to the right to determine the path specific to that branch, e.g. assign to a teammate or let Fin answer.\nFor example, you can use a \"Message Content\" filter to route conversations which contain the keyword \"billing\" directly to your Billing team.\nWith\nAI category detection [closed beta]\n, Fin can categorize conversations by topic and use these AI categories as conditions in workflows to automatically route conversations to the right team, ensuring customer requests are handled efficiently.\nPreview your Fin over chat workflow\nIf you want to test a Fin over chat workflow, select the\nPreview\nbutton at the top of the Workflows builder. This will give you an interactive preview of the Messenger experience when talking to Fin.\nBest practices for chat workflows\nThe\nSimple deploy\nfor Fin AI Agent takes priority and will trigger before\nAdvanced setup through Workflows\n. Please keep this in mind if setting Fin live through \"Simple deploy\" and adding Fin to your workflows.\nWe don't recommend having multiple workflows per topic. We recommend you have one workflow for your inbound chat, with each conversation topic defined using branches.\nWhen creating a workflow, you should always set a path for \"Else\". In the event a customer doesn\u2019t fall under a specific topic or audience, this ensures there is a fallback option to support them.\nAnalyze and optimize Fin over chat\nAfter you've deployed Fin over chat, go to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze\nto get real-time metrics like Customer Experience (CX) score, automated conversation analysis at scale, and AI-powered suggestions for optimizing Fin.\nHere, you'll find the following dashboards:\nPerformance\nTopics Explorer\nOptimize\nConversations\nLearn how to use Insights for Fin\n.\nAs you analyze Fin\u2019s performance and identify opportunities for improvement, you\u2019ll need to continuously train, test, and deploy Fin to achieve an increasing number of resolutions.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nRolling Fin AI Agent out to customers\nFin AI Agent resolutions\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over email\nUse Fin AI Agent in Workflows"},

Please keep this in mind if setting Fin live through \"Simple deploy\" and adding Fin to your workflows.\nNot all workflow steps are available over email.\nCheck what actions are compatible with this channel\n. For this reason, we recommend creating a separate workflow solely for email as a channel i.e. don't add email / Fin over email to a workflow that has been set up for Messenger.\nWe don't recommend having multiple workflows per topic. We recommend you have one workflow for your email channel, with each email topic defined using branches.\nWhen creating a workflow, you should always set a path for \"Else\". In the event a customer doesn\u2019t fall under a specific topic or audience, this ensures there is a fallback option to support them.\nAnalyze and optimize Fin over email\nAfter you've deployed Fin over chat, go to\nFin AI Agent > Analyze\nto get real-time metrics like Customer Experience (CX) score, automated conversation analysis at scale, and AI-powered suggestions for optimizing Fin.\nHere, you'll find the following dashboards:\nPerformance\nTopics Explorer\nOptimize\nConversations\nLearn how to use Insights for Fin\n.\nAs you analyze Fin\u2019s performance and identify opportunities for improvement, you\u2019ll need to continuously train, test, and deploy Fin to achieve an increasing number of resolutions.\nFin over email customer experience\nFin AI Agent will reply to questions over email the same way it does over chat. The main differences are how responses are formatted and Fin can also participate in group conversations over email.\nWhen Fin replies to an email, it will:\nIndicate that it\u2019s an AI agent.\nProvide the source of the answer (if public to your audience).\nGive users options for next steps, including speaking to a teammate.\nShow your email signature.\nShow the AI disclosure and sources in a footer below the signature.\nThe email will always include a sentence indicating it was generated via AI to ensure transparency with customers. This disclosure helps set the right expectations by informing customers that they are interacting with an AI agent rather than a human. It also aligns with best practices for AI communication, where clarity about the nature of the interaction is crucial. Additionally, this transparency can help manage customer expectations regarding the type of assistance they are receiving and provide them with options for next steps, such as speaking to a human teammate if needed.\nIf the customer's message is not clear, Fin will send a message asking to clarify what they need assistance with.\nIf Fin doesn't have an answer, it will let the customer know and give them the option to ask another question or talk to a person. Fin will not send any error messages over email like it does for chat (i.e \u201cOops, something went wrong\u201d). Instead, it will immediately route to your team.\nWhen the customer responds, they have the following options:\nReply with additional information.\nClick\nThat helped\nbutton or send a reply confirming the answer helped, which will mark the conversation as a confirmed resolution.\nClick\nTalk to a person\nbutton or reply asking for help, which will mark the conversation as \u201cRouted to team\u201d and trigger the handover process, if one has been set up.\nIf a customer clicks on a quick reply button in the email, they'll be redirected to an Intercom-hosted URL with a confirmation message.\nNote:\nThe webpage that opens up will use the same styling colors that you have\nconfigured for your Messenger\n.\nThe quick reply buttons will expire one week after Fin's email is sent, or if someone replies to the email thread after it was sent.\nCustomers will also receive a follow-up email confirming the action:\nWhen a customer clicks\nTalk to a person\n(or replies with a variation of this), the handover between Fin AI Agent and a teammate will be triggered.\nWhen a customer clicks\nThat helped\n(or replies with a variation of this), Fin AI Agent will respond and close the conversation - unless otherwise configured.\nFin over email filtering spam messages\nIntercom has a sophisticated\nbuilt-in spam filtering system\nthat automatically checks incoming emails for hidden links, malware, phishing attempts, and proper authentication of sender's address. We assign all inbound emails a spam score and filter messages that exceed our spam threshold.\nThe spam inbox holds all spam emails caught by the traditional filter. These conversations do\nnot\nhave conversation IDs and therefore do\nnot\ncount towards reporting.\nFin over email has its own spam detection, which takes place after our default spam filtering. If the email reaches Fin and it's determined as spam, the conversation will route to the inbox (not the spam folder). In these cases, you will see a conversation event:\n\"Fin decided this email is junk or spam and did not respond\"\nand it will be closed.\nThese conversations would count as Fin-involved, but will not count as a resolution.\nThese emails\ndo\nhave conversation IDs, as all emails that make it to your inbox receive one. Therefore, this conversations\ndo\ncount toward reporting.\nBy default, emails marked as auto responders go to your Spam folder but if you need these to appear in your inbox, you can turn off this setting so they are routed to the inbox from\nSettings > Channels > Email > Email settings\n.\nDo not use your custom domain email address to sign up to newsletters or advertisements. This will prevent Fin from getting involved in these conversations.\nFAQs\nIs multilingual Fin available over email?\nYes, Fin for email is also multilingual and can assist your customers in different languages. To learn more about this feature and how it works, check out the article\nMultilingual Fin AI Agent\n.\nHow are Fin email conversations and resolutions billed?\nFin AI Agent conversations over email are charged on a per\nresolution\nbasis, the same as all other available channels.\nHow does Fin over email work with Customer tickets?\nFin AI Agent over email will respond to Customer tickets the same as it does with conversations. This includes the email setting to\nauto-convert emails into tickets\n, where emails will be automatically converted into tickets and Fin will handle the ticket conversation as normal.\nWhy is Fin replying to emails with a handle like \"Examply at Examply,\" and how can I fix it?\nThis happens when your AI agent is using the same name as your brand. If both the bot and the brand name are set to \"Examply,\" the email sender name will appear as \"Examply from Examply.\"\nTo fix this, change the AI agent's name:\nGo to\nSettings > AI & Automation > Automation\n.\nUnder\nChoose an identity for your bots\n, update the bot\u2019s name to something different from your brand name.\nThis will ensure the sender name appears correctly in emails sent by Fin.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nFin AI Agent reporting\nFin AI Agent resolutions\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over chat\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nUse Fin AI Agent in Workflows"},

Before you set Fin AI Agent live, you'll have plenty of opportunities to review the end-to-end experience for both your customers and your teammates.\nBelow are some ways to test Fin AI Agent internally and gradually roll Fin out to your customers.\nTarget Fin AI Agent at a specific audience\nThe audience rules for Fin AI Agent are configured differently depending on how you've set Fin up:\nFrom the Fin over chat setup\n, or\nFrom the Fin over email setup\n, or\nFrom a Workflow\n, or\nWithout Workflows\n.\nFrom the Fin over chat setup\nAudience rules from the Fin over chat setup are configured in the\nWho will see Fin\nsection under\nFin AI Agent > Deploy > Chat\n.\nFrom the Fin over email setup\nAudience rules from the Fin over email setup are configured in the\nWho will see Fin\nsection under\nFin AI Agent > Deploy > Email\n.\nFrom a Workflow\nAudience rules for a Workflow are configured in the\ntrigger settings\nby clicking on the trigger or first step in the Workflows builder.\nNote:\nAudience rules will apply to all channels you\u2019ve enabled for Fin AI Agent.\nYou'll need to have a live\nMessenger installed\nbefore you can test Fin on your website.\nSet Fin AI Agent live for your team\nTo share Fin AI Agent with your team and allow them to test it themselves, you can set Fin live on your website and use audience rules to target your team only. This will also allow you to check that your handover rules are running as you intended.\nFor example, you could select \u2018Users\u2019 and use the filter \u2018Email contains\u2026\u2019 to target teammates with your company email address.\nNow Fin will be live for the users you specified. Those users will be able to interact with Fin by asking it questions in the Messenger.\nCreate a set of control questions to share with your team and ask them to note whether Fin provided the best response or not. This can also be a great way to identify gaps in your support content.\nIf you test Fin in your live environment, Fin will be billed\nper resolution\n.\nHowever, if you or your teammate has asked to \"Get more help\" or speak to your team, the conversation is considered 'unresolved' and you would not be charged for this.\nRoll Fin AI Agent out to customers\nWe recommend rolling Fin AI Agent out in stages by customer segment, such as starting with lower-tiered customers who would benefit the most from self-service, or by region. This approach allows you to supervise Fin closely and feel confident with how Fin works in your product.\nHere are some ways you can identify and target customers:\nSpecific tiers\nFor example, you could enable Fin AI Agent for everyone except VIP customers by specifying \u2018Users\u2019 and using a\ncustom data attribute\nyou\u2019re tracking such as \u2018VIP customer is false\u2019.\nOr, target only self-serve customers or users on a specific price plan by using a\ncustom data attribute\nsuch as \u2018Plan is Free\u2019.\nAn audience can become super targeted by combining\nAnd / Or filters\n. For example, you could use the \u2018Last seen\u2019 and \u2018Region\u2019 attributes to target only new users in a specific region.\nUsers or leads only\nYou can also make Fin AI Agent only available to logged in users, or only available to visitors to your website who reach out through the Messenger and become leads. Simply select this audience from the dropdown.\nYou can target users of a particular part of your product by selecting \u2018Users\u2019 and a\ncustom data attribute\nsuch as \u2018Projects is greater than 1\u2019.\nSpecific page URLs\nEnable Fin AI Agent only on specific pages by using the \u2018Current Page URL\u2019 attribute and entering the URL for that page. For example, you could target it at customers who are visiting your support page.\nOr, if you want to see how much impact it has on reducing conversation volume for your team, you could target a page which drives a high volume of conversations.\nMake sure you understand\nhow audience rules and filters work\nto ensure you\u2019re capturing the right audience and Fin AI Agent is able to get involved in these conversations.\nSee the impact of Fin AI Agent\nUsing reporting\nCreate a\nFin AI Agent report\nto closely keep an eye on Fin's performance and key metrics like resolution rate, involvement rate, Fin CSAT, and more.\nLearn more about the\nFin AI Agent report\n.\nMonitoring responses\nThe\nFin AI Agent\nsection in the Inbox allows you to monitor all conversations where your AI agent was involved.

It helps you check content coverage, debug unexpected results, and refine Fin\u2019s behavior across brands, users, languages, and automations.\nKey benefits / use cases:\nValidate Fin\u2019s answers\nacross multiple brands and user profiles before going live.\nDiagnose and fix content gaps\nby inspecting the source, personality, and guidance behind each response.\nOrganize test runs\ninto reusable groups to track changes over time.\nSee when automations trigger\n, including Fin tasks, actions, and custom answers.\nControl language settings\nand ensure real-time translations work as expected.\nBatch Test is designed for all customers who use Intercom to support conversations \u2013 whether you\u2019re an existing Fin customer or simply looking to explore its potential.\nTo access Batch Test for Fin, teammates must have a\nfull seat\nand their\nconversation access permission\nset to \"All conversations\".\nHow to use Batch test\n1. Access Batch test\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Test\nfrom the main navigation. Choose how to add questions:\nGenerate from inbox\n- Generate up to 50 questions based on your past conversations.\nIf\nAI Insights Topic categories\nare available in your workspace, you can automatically generate questions based on your conversation topics.\nAdd manually\n- Copy and paste a list of questions, or add them one by one manually.\nUpload CSV file\n- Import up to 50 questions at once by uploading a CSV file.\nNote:\nYou can upload up to 50 questions per test group.\nYou must have a minimum of 1 conversation in the last 90 days for the\nGenerate from inbox\noption to appear.\nThe \"Can access people, companies, and account lists\" and \"Can access lead and user profile pages\" permissions are required as well.\n2. Configure your test\nYour test questions will automatically start running using a generic preview user to access all content and trigger all automations without targeting. To configure these test settings, click the\nManage\ndropdown at the top of the page and then select\nSettings.\nTest as\nChoose how to test Fin by simulating users or audiences. You can choose to test Fin as:\nUser or Lead\n-  Test Fin as a user or lead, with available content, guidance, and automations (tasks, data connectors, and custom answers).Select a user to see how Fin tailors responses based on\nuser attributes\n, such as language, location, plan, and more. Perfect for validating setups before launch or troubleshooting post-deployment. You can select from a dropdown list of contacts in your workspace, and select to simulate as that specific user. This is particularly useful if you have test users already setup in your workspace. However, you can also search and select real users/leads within your workspace.\nAudience\n- Test Fin as audience(s), with audience-specific content and guidance. Automations will not run.\nPreview User\n- Test Fin with all live content, guidance, and automations included.\nBrand\nIf you've\nset up multiple brands on your workspace\n, you can select the brand you would like to test. For example, the content might be different for this brand so the Fin response can be tested to ensure these nuances are being picked up.\nClick\nConfirm\nto re-run the test with these settings.\n3. Run the test and inspect responses\nOnce you run a test, you can view Fin\u2019s generated response for each question.\nUse the \"Evaluate answer\" panel to see:\nPersonality\nsettings (e.g. tone of voice)\nGuidance\n(if\nconfigured\n)\nContent sources\nFin pulled from\nAutomations\n(e.g., Fin Tasks, Data connectors, or Custom Answers triggered)\nWhile you can\u2019t directly edit automations triggered in a Batch test, the panel links out to the relevant configuration screen for you to review or quickly make adjustments.\n4. Add a new question\nTo add a new question, go to\nFin AI Agent > Test\nfrom the main navigation. Then, click the\n+ add question\nbutton. A dropdown menu will appear, offering you various options for how you'd like to add your questions.\nGenerate more from all conversations\n- You can create up to 50 questions from your past conversations.\nGenerate more by Topic\n- If\nAI Insights Topic categories\nare available in your workspace, questions can be automatically generated based on your conversation topics.\nUpload more from a CSV\n- Import up to 50 questions at once by uploading a CSV file.\nAdd more manually\n- You can either copy and paste a list of questions or add them one by one.\n5. Adjust language settings and translations\nTo help you get accurate responses in the correct language, Batch test makes it easy to check and update your\nLanguage support\nand\nReal-time translation\nsettings during testing.\nIf you\u2019re seeing a response in a different language than expected\u2014for example, if a question in Russian gets a reply in English\u2014it provides clear messages in yellow explaining why this might be happening and how to fix the issue.\nOnce you enable the appropriate settings and\nrefresh the answer\n, Fin's responses will appear in the correct language.\nYou might need to enable just one or both settings, depending on your current configuration. Don\u2019t worry\u2014you can turn them on simultaneously and come back to this screen.\n6. Rate and refine answers\nRate answers as\nGood\n,\nAcceptable\n, or\nPoor\nand provide additional context for any rating, with all feedback captured in a downloadable report to help prioritize updates effectively.\nIf you select\nPoor\n, choose a reason and click\nImprove this answer\nto view dynamic recommendations to fix it.\nRating answers does\nnot\ntrain Fin directly. You'll need to improve answers by clicking\nImprove this answer\nto see recommendations such as updating an existing article, or adding Guidance for Fin.\n7. Filter a test and make bulk updates\nFilter a test by\nAnswer status:\nAny\n- all questions added to the test group.\nAnswered questions\n- only questions where Fin provided a direct answer, disambiguation, or automation (e.g. workflow handover, Fin Task, etc.)\nUnanswered questions\n- only questions where Fin couldn't provide an answer or trigger any follow-up action.\nFilter a test by\nAnswer rating:\nAny\nGood\nAcceptable\nPoor\nMake bulk updates using the checkboxes on the left of the question. This allows you to bulk update Q+A pairs to download certain questions, delete those questions or update the answer associated with that question.\n8. Save and organize test groups\nYou can use\ntest groups\nto organize and save up to 50 questions and responses in the testing area. This is the maximum number you can upload at once, making it a handy way to group related questions for easier review and reuse. Each test group retains the settings you used during testing\u2014like simulating a specific user\u2014so you can re-run tests with the same configuration anytime.\nClick\nManage\nat the top of the page to select the option + Create new group.\nFrom there, you have several flexible options to populate your new test group with questions:\nGenerate from inbox:\nPull questions directly from your existing conversations, either from all conversations or by specific topics.\nManually add:\nEnter questions one by one.\nUpload a CSV file:\nImport multiple questions quickly using a CSV file.\nClick\nManage\nto rename a group or delete a test group.\nClick the name of your test group to create additional groups, or select a different group you've previously saved.\nTest groups are especially useful for organizing questions by topic. For example, if you\u2019ve tested and reviewed a batch of insurance claim questions, you can save them as a group labeled \u201cInsurance Claim Questions.\u201d This makes it simple to revisit, rerun, or evaluate that content later.\nThey\u2019re also great for managing team collaboration. Since Batch test is a workspace-level feature, using test groups lets teammates keep their test runs separate. Instead of deleting previous tests to make space, you can save them into groups to preserve everyone\u2019s work.\n9. Download a CSV report\nA CSV file can be generated, compiling all questions, answers, user-applied ratings, and the sources utilized for each response. Simply click\nManage\nat the top of the page and then select\nGet CSV report\n.\nThis is great for sharing results with your wider team for collaboration, or visibility for senior leaders to review.\nFAQs\nWhat\u2019s not testable in Batch test?\nFin Vision\n(image recognition) isn\u2019t supported in the Batch test section yet.\nWill I be charged for resolutions when using Batch test?\nNo, the Fin AI Agent > Test page is free to use and you won't be charged for AI answers generated through the Batch test. \ud83d\udc4c\nCan I generate test questions automatically?\nYes, you can generate test questions automatically.

To get the best results, follow these best practices when writing guidance for Fin.\nFin Guidance best practices\nStart with the outcome in mind\nBefore writing Fin Guidance, consider the\nspecific result\nyou want to achieve. Work backward from this goal to create clear, actionable instructions.\n\u274c\nBad example (vague and ineffective):\n\u201cMake sure Fin understands our different product types before answering.\u201d\n\u2705\nGood example (clear and structured):\n\u201cIf a customer asks about the \u2018search\u2019 feature, first ask which product they are using before responding. Then, provide product-specific instructions based on their answer.\u201d\nBy structuring guidance with clear steps and conditions, Fin can apply it consistently and correctly.\nUse simple and precise language\nAmbiguous or overly complex Fin Guidance can lead to inconsistent responses. Write as if you\u2019re training a new support agent\u2014be\ndirect, specific, and easy to understand\n.\n\u274c\nBad example (unclear and open to interpretation):\n\u201cFin should be professional but also friendly, keeping responses engaging.\u201d\n\u2705\nGood example (defined and actionable):\n\u201cUse a professional yet approachable tone. Keep responses concise, avoid jargon, and use reassuring language when addressing customer frustrations (e.g., \u2018I understand how that can be frustrating. Here\u2019s how we can resolve it\u2019).\u201d\nProvide context and concrete examples\nFin performs best when it understands when and how to apply guidance. Use words like \u201cif,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d to define conditions, and include clear examples.\n\u274c Bad example (lacks context):\n\u201cWhen customers ask about pricing, make sure Fin answers correctly.\u201d\n\u2705\nGood example (context-driven and detailed):\n\u201cIf a customer asks about pricing, first check if they mention a specific plan. If they don\u2019t, ask which plan they\u2019re interested in before providing details. Always refer to prices as \u2018starting at [lowest tier price]\u2019 unless the customer specifies a plan.\u201d\nCreate separate, focused guidance\nEach piece of Fin Guidance should address a single objective. Avoid mixing multiple instructions, as this can make it harder for Fin to apply them correctly.\n\u274c Bad example (too broad and unfocused):\n\u201cFin should use a friendly tone, clarify questions before answering, and escalate billing issues to an agent.\u201d\n\u2705 Good example (one clear purpose per entry):\nCommunication style guidance: \u201cFin should maintain a warm, friendly tone by using positive language and avoiding overly formal phrases.\u201d\nContext and clarification guidance: \u201cIf a customer asks about refunds but does not specify a purchase date, ask for the date before proceeding.\u201d\nHandover and escalation guidance: \u201cIf a customer mentions \u2018billing error\u2019 or \u2018overcharge,\u2019 immediately escalate the conversation to a human agent.\u201d\nSpeak directly to Fin in your guidance\nWhen writing Fin Guidance, avoid referring to Fin in the third person or commenting on how it should modify its responses. Instead, write as if you are speaking directly to Fin, telling it exactly what to do.\n\u274c Bad example (third-person and indirect)\n\u201cIf the AI answer tells the customer to uninstall and reinstall the app, then rewrite the answer to remove that information, as reinstalling is not a valid troubleshooting step.\u201d\n\u2705 Good example (direct and actionable)\n\u201cNever tell the customer to uninstall and reinstall the app. Reinstalling is never a valid troubleshooting step, and Fin should never communicate this to the customer.\u201d\nUse article titles to guide responses\nIf you want Fin to reference specific source content in its response, you can mention the title of the source in your Guidance.\nImportant caveats:\nGuidance does\nnot\ninfluence which articles are\nretrieved\nby Fin.\nIf an article wasn\u2019t retrieved based on the customer\u2019s original query, Guidance can\u2019t make Fin use it.\nGuidance can\u2019t add extra context to the customer\u2019s query in order to retrieve different or additional content.\nGuidance only helps Fin generate a better response using the content it's already retrieved.\nSo, your Guidance should be based on the customer\u2019s original query and the content that was likely retrieved as a result.\n\u274c\nBad example\n(tells Fin which content to use):\n\"If the customer says 'upgrade' use information from the source titled 'Subscription Management' to form your response.\"\n\u2705\nGood example\n(helps Fin respond if the relevant content is retrieved):\n\u201cIf a customer asks about upgrading their plan, which can be found in the source titled \u2018Subscription Management,\u2019 then make sure you highlight where they can do this and include all the steps to upgrade a plan in your response.\u201d\nDetermine when to use audience targeting vs. user attributes\nIf you\u2019re deciding whether or not your Fin Guidance should apply based on a user\u2019s data, it\u2019s usually best to use the\nAudience targeting\nfeature. Targeting an audience completely hides any non-matching guidance from Fin, which means there\u2019s no risk of confusion or duplication.\nFor example:\nIf you\nonly\nwant the guidance to apply when a user is on the \u201cPro\u201d plan,\ncreate an audience\nfor\n\"Plan is Pro\"\n, then select this audience when creating your guidance. Fin will only see that guidance when it\u2019s relevant.\nOn the other hand, if you want Fin to reference the actual value of a\nuser attribute\nin its response, you should include that attribute directly in your guidance.\nFor example:\n\u201cAddress the user by name:\n{user_name}\n.\u201d\n\u201cUse formal pronouns if\n{user_pronoun_formality}\nis \u2018formal\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cMention features available in\n{user_plan}\nwhen describing functionality.\u201d\nQuick rule of thumb:\nUse audience rules if you\u2019re\nfiltering\nwhen the guidance should apply.\nUse attributes in the guidance itself if you\u2019re\ncustomizing\nthe response content based on user data.\nContinuously refine your guidance\nThink of Fin Guidance as an ongoing process. Start with essential instructions and improve them over time based on real interactions and performance metrics.\nTest Fin\u2019s responses in Preview Mode to ensure the guidance works as expected.\nRegularly review and refine guidance based on metrics and customer feedback.\nRemove or update conflicting or redundant guidance to keep Fin\u2019s behavior consistent.\nTip:\nIf you\u2019re unsure how to write guidance for a specific use case, try using a writing tool like Claude AI or ChatGPT. Describe the scenario and ask it to generate a clear, AI-friendly prompt that\u2019s easy to interpret.\nFin Guidance examples\nBelow you will find some examples of Fin Guidance. You can use these as inspiration or adapt these for your specific needs.\nCommunication style\nSpecific vocabulary and terminology Fin should use.\nWe offer Free, Pro, and Enterprise plans. They should be capitalized and referred to as \u201cplans\u201d rather than \u201csubscriptions\u201d.\nAlways answer in British English.\nUse plain language, avoiding jargon or buzzwords. For example, use \"easy\" instead of \"frictionless\".\nIf the user is frustrated, show empathy and use calming language to let them know that you care about helping them out\u2014for example, \u201cI understand this is frustrating, and I apologize. I am going to work through this with you to find a suitable solution\u201d. Feel free to use different variations of this example.\nAnswers should be always readable and concise: sentences should be short, there should be at most 1-2 sentences per paragraph and no more than 100 words per answer (unless absolutely necessary). Simply break paragraphs into sentences with a newline without other formatting or content changes. Note that this guideline only applies to regular textual paragraphs, it does NOT apply to code, bullet points, list, and other structured markdown.\nNever ask the user to contact <\ncompany name\n> through email as they're already contacting <\ncompany name\n>'s customer support through the chat messenger. For example, remove passages such as \"please email us at <\ncompany email\n>\" from any AI message. In those cases, tell the user instead that if they need further help, they should request human assistance by asking to speak with the team.\nEnd interactions with a brief, inclusive seasonal greeting that fits the customer's language and region when clear from the conversation. Keep greetings short and at the end of responses. Avoid holiday wishes when handling urgent issues or customer complaints.\nUse one or two emojis in your responses to create a friendly and engaging tone.\nContext and clarification\nFollow-up questions Fin should ask, to ensure accurate answers.\nIf a user is having an issue completing a purchase, ask if they are trying to use bank transfer or a credit card.\nIf a user asks what features they have access to, first clarify which plan they are on.\nIf a user reports that they are seeing a 502 error, let them know that we are aware of the problem and are currently investigating as a matter of priority. They can follow for updates on:\nhttps://www.intercomstatus.com/\nDo not assume what mobile app the user has. Always ask if they are an iOS or Android user when they report an error. Each app has a different subset of features, so it\u2019s important to understand this first.\nWhen a user reports a bug, first ask for the following information before continuing troubleshooting: 1) what device are you using? 2) URL where the bug is occurring; 3) when was the bug first noticed.\nIf the customer inquires about delivery options, check their {{country}} and provide a response that aligns with the delivery options available for that specific country.\nHandover and escalation\nMoments when Fin should route customers straight to your team.\nIf a user asks about cancelling their plan, always hand the conversation over to a human agent.\nIf the user mentions any of the following tax-related terms, always hand the conversation over to a human agent: tax planning, tax consulting, tax advice.\nIf a user requests a task that requires agent action, always hand the conversation over to a human agent immediately. These tasks include: Exporting the analytics dashboard as a CSV, Generating a code snippet for camera installation, Updating a compliance document\nWhen a patient requests to book an appointment with Dr. Mills, always hand the conversation over to a human agent.\nIf the customer\u2019s {Pricing Plan Name} is \"Pro\", always hand the conversation over to a human agent.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nManage content and guidance targeting for AI answers\nFin Tasks and Data connectors FAQs\nProvide Fin AI Agent with specific guidance\nTest Fin AI Agent\nBest practices for Fin Tasks"},

Define how Fin communicates so it speaks like your best-trained agents\u2014delivering high-quality support that stays true to your brand\nContext and clarification:\nGuide Fin to ask thoughtful follow-up questions, reducing miscommunication and helping it get to the right answer faster\u2014so customers reach a resolution sooner.\nHandover and escalation:\nDefine rules so Fin recognizes when an issue is sensitive and escalates it promptly\u2014ensuring customers get the right support at the right time and complex issues are handled with care. When Fin decides to follow your handover and escalation guidance, it will follow the triaging and routing flow that you've defined via Simple deploy or Workflows.\nEverything else:\nAnything that does not fit into the above categories should be added here. This could be specific company or support policies that you\u2019d like Fin to adhere to, such as never asking customers to contact you by phone.\nYou'll find guidance templates within each category to help you get started. You can modify the wording of a template to suit your needs.\nTip:\nRead our\nFin Guidance best practices\nbefore you get started to learn the dos and don\u2019ts of writing good guidance prompts.\nNote:\nTo ensure guidance works effectively, make sure it is assigned to the correct category.\nYou can create up to 250 pieces of guidance. Each guidance can be up to 2,500 characters in length.\nCreate new Fin Guidance\nSet up the basics\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Train > Guidance\nand select\nBasics\nto choose Fin's tone of voice and answer length.\nLearn more about customizing Fin's personality\n.\nAdd guidance\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Train > Guidance\nand click +\nNew\nto add new guidance to the appropriate category.\nEnter your guidance in the text field or choose from one of the templates to get started quickly.\nOptimize Fin Guidance\nAfter writing a piece of guidance, click\nOptimize\nto have it reviewed by our AI-powered writing assistant.

You\u2019ll be able to compare the suggestion with your original text and choose to accept, edit, or refine it further.\nTip:\nIf you\u2019re unsure how to write a prompt for a specific use case, try using a writing tool like Claude AI or ChatGPT. Describe the scenario and ask it to generate a clear, AI-friendly prompt that\u2019s easy to interpret.\nAdd audience rules to Fin Guidance\nApply audiences to Fin Guidance if you want to target specific customer segments with tailored guidance. This ensures that Fin only uses guidance for customers who match the selected audience, and ignores it for those who don\u2019t\u2014resulting in more accurate and controlled guidance behavior.\nSimply create your guidance and then select an audience from the\nAudience\ndropdown menu.\nFor example:\n\u201cIf a user explicitly says that they want to cancel their plan, or expresses frustration regarding a pricing or billing issue, respond with empathy by acknowledging their feelings, validating their concerns. Then confirm which plan they are on and then route the conversation to a human and say a human will be with you shortly.\"\nNote:\nAudiences must be\nset up in your workspace\nto use them with Fin.\nUse attributes in Fin Guidance\nUser, company, or conversation attributes can also be included in your guidance to personalize responses. For example:\n\u201cWhen relevant and appropriate, refer to the user's name as {First name} or their company name as {Company name} to make responses feel more personal and engaging.\"\nHere, the placeholders {First name} and {Company name} will automatically populate with the customer\u2019s name or their company's name before Fin generates a response.\nNote:\nData attributes won't always be used by Fin. If you want to set strict targeting rules,\nadd an audience\nto the guidance prompt instead. This gives you precise, reliable control over when and how Fin applies guidance\u2014making your support experience more predictable and tailored to each customer segment.\nLearn when to use\naudience targeting vs. user attributes\nin your guidance.\n\u200b\nGive channel specific guidance\nTailor Fin\u2019s behavior based on the channel customers use to contact you. First,\nset up an audience\n(e.g.\n\"Current channel is Email\"\n) and then apply specific guidelines when customers reach out through that channel. This ensures Fin responds appropriately based on the channel context.\nFor example:\n\u201cAvoid suggesting they contact us by phone for further support.\u201d\nTest Fin Guidance\nBefore you save or enable a piece of guidance, you can use the\nPreview\npanel to ask Fin some questions and see how your new guidance is applied.\nWhen you're happy with how Fin is using your guidance, click\nEnable\nto set the guidance live for Fin's conversations with customers.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWe've always take into consideration all Guidance when testing in the Preview. That includes draft, paused and live guidance. The reason being is we don't want customers to have to set guidance live in order to test changes to it.\nSee Fin Guidance performance\nOnce your guidance is enabled, you can track its impact on Fin\u2019s conversations. Go to\nFin AI Agent > Train > Guidance\nto see how often a piece of guidance was used and what percentage of those conversations were resolved or routed to your team.\nClick on these stats to:\nView a list of conversations where the guidance was used.\nUse advanced filtering to uncover patterns and insights.\nClick into a conversation to preview the interaction and see how guidance influenced Fin\u2019s response.\nThese insights help you refine your guidance, ensuring Fin consistently delivers accurate and effective support.\nIn Reports\nCreate a report from\nReports\nand add the \"Guidance applied\" filter to see metrics where that guidance was used.\nIn the Inbox\nYou can also see when Fin applies your guidance in the\nInbox\n. The\nconversation events\nrecord which specific pieces of guidance were used as part of a response.\n\u2728\nNew: Content Guidance (Beta)\nContent Guidance lets you specify the content Fin should refer to when answering particular types of questions. This gives you more control over which knowledge sources Fin relies on, ensuring more accurate and consistent answers.\nThis feature is in closed beta. If you\u2019d like access or have questions, reach out to\nzoe.sinnott@intercom.io\n.\nFAQs\nHow does Fin Guidance work?\nFin Guidance works alongside the other content and data sources you provide. Before generating a response, our\nAI Engine\nchecks for relevant guidance and applies it to ensure Fin\u2019s response aligns with your policies.\nGuidance can also use the following context to adjust Fin's response if these are referenced in the guidance prompts:\nThe current date and time.\nThe\nchannel\nthe conversation is using (Messenger chat, Android, iOS, email, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and SMS).\nAudience\nrules that have been applied to the guidance.\nAttributes\nthat have been specifically referenced in the guidance.\nThe conversation history.\nThe language the customer is using in the conversation.\nThe brand name and bot identity you have configured for your workspace.\nLearn more about the technology behind\nIntercom's patented AI agent, Fin\n.\nHow does using Fin Guidance impact Fin\u2019s response time?\nUsing Fin Guidance adds a slight delay of a few seconds to Fin\u2019s responses. This delay remains the same regardless of how much guidance you have - it\u2019s the use of\nany\nguidance that introduces latency.\nWhat can Fin Guidance not be used for?\nFin Guidance cannot:\nTake actions on the conversation (other than handing over to the team).\nFor example, guidance cannot be used to route handovers or escalations to a specific team inbox, tag conversations, update conversation attributes, mark conversations as priority or take any other actions. Instead, these should be configured via Fin AI Agent\nSimple deploy\nor\nWorkflows\n.\nControl which content sources Fin generates a response from for different types of users.\nIf you want Fin to use specific content when responding to customers, you can\napply audience rules to the content in Knowledge\n.\nRead or re-write Custom Answers.\nCustom Answers are hardcoded and not supported with Fin Guidance.\nAdd conversation tags\nor pull information from specific content sources based on a prompt.\nHow can I ensure my guidance is written effectively?\nFollow our\nbest practices and review the examples\n.\nCheck your guidance wording by running it through a writing tool like Claude AI or ChatGPT to ensure clarity and ease of interpretation.\nTest your guidance using the preview to see how Fin would answer related questions. Whenever you update your guidance, you can test it before you set it live.\nHow can Guidance be used to customize Fin\u2019s escalation behavior for customers?\nGuidance settings let you tailor how Fin escalates customer conversations. For example, you can set Fin to escalate directly (not just offer) when a customer requests human support, appears angry, or gets stuck in a repetitive loop. Guidance also allows you to adjust Fin\u2019s sensitivity to frustration or specific keywords, like \u201cagent\u201d\u2014so escalation happens exactly when and how you want. This ensures customers get the right support at the right time.\nDo Fin Guidance based handovers contribute to the Fin AI Agent routed to team rate?\nYes, Fin Guidance based handovers follow the same route as non-guidance based handovers.\nDoes the Messenger preview for Fin take the customer's attributes into account?\nThe Messenger preview for Fin does take the customer's attributes into account, but the customer will be the Preview User. So for example the name will be \"Preview User\" and not \"John Smith\".\nThe best way to test different user experiences depending on the user's attributes is to set Fin live to a limited\ntest audience\n.\nCan Fin Guidance be written in a language other than English?\nYes, Fin Guidance can be written in another language. However, it is recommended to use the language you are most comfortable with to clearly express the guidance you need Fin to follow.\nCan emojis be used with Fin Guidance?\nBy default, Fin will not use emojis in it's AI answers; however, you can add guidance in the 'Communication Style' category to prompt usage. For example, adding\n\"Use one or two emojis in your responses to create a friendly and engaging tone\"\nwill then lead Fin to use one or two emojis in your responses.\nHow do I test escalation guidance in Fin for email?\nTo test Fin's escalation guidance over email, you can use the email preview option.\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Deploy > Email\n.\nClick \"Copy address\".\nSend an email to the copied address from the email address you used to sign up to Intercom.\nOnce you've previewed the experience, you can set Fin live.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over chat\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over email\nCustomize Fin AI Agent's personality\nUse Fin AI Agent in Workflows\nFin Guidance best practices"},

Was jetzt?\u201d\n(translation to English:\n\"Hey, I can't log into my account anymore. What now?\"\n):\nLet Fin decide\nWith this setting enabled, Fin automatically chooses the pronoun formality for you. Fin tends to follow the same language style as the person it's speaking to. For example, if the person uses the informal \"tu\" in French, Fin responds with informal pronouns. If the person uses the formal \"Sie\" in German, Fin responds with formal pronouns.\nNote:\nWhile this makes pronoun formality more consistent, we can't guarantee that it will always use the correct pronouns as the underlying technology is non-deterministic and can sometimes deviate from instructions.\nThe pronoun formality setting does not apply to English. We recommend using this setting if your language has an explicit distinction between formal and informal pronouns.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nFin AI Agent explained\nUse Fin AI Agent in multiple languages\nCustomize Fin AI Agent's personality\nTest Fin AI Agent\nFin Guidance best practices"},

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/11433030-a-more-conversational-human-fin-experience", "title": "A more conversational, human Fin experience", "content": "We\u2019re updating Fin\u2019s Messenger experience to make conversations more natural, human, and effective. These changes improve how Fin interacts with your customers, when and how it escalates to your team, and how answer sources are presented.\nNote:\nThese updates are currently being made to the\nMessenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook channels only\n. We aim to apply these changes to other channels, including email, in the coming months.\nThese improvements don't impact your Fin settings or existing handover rules and escalation guidance.\nFin is more conversational\nFin will now respond more naturally, without relying on rigid decision trees or quick reply buttons to determine when and how to escalate. This change makes interactions feel more conversational, engaging, and human. As a result, users tend to share more context in their replies, which helps Fin provide more tailored and helpful answers.\nCustomers will be able to:\nIndicate that Fin has answered their question\nby responding positively (e.g., typing \u201cThat helped,\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d or \u201cOK, thanks\u201d) when Fin asks, \u201cDid that help?\u201d\nIndicate that Fin has not answered their question\nby responding with negative feedback (e.g., typing \u201cNo\u201d when Fin asks, \u201cDid that help?\u201d)\nIf they respond with negative feedback, Fin will escalate the conversation to your team.\nExample: A customer types, \u201cNo, that didn\u2019t solve my issue.\u201d Fin will escalate this to your team.\nSee the\nFAQs\nfor further information on how resolutions are counted.\nEscalation uses natural language\nFin can also detect when a customer needs human support and will offer to escalate at the right time using intuitive, conversational prompts.\nYour customers can ask to speak with a human directly, and Fin will guide them through the handoff using clear, conversational prompts. For example: A customer says, \u201cCan I talk to someone?\u201d Fin will guide them to your team in a smooth, human way.\nFin can also proactively offer to escalate in situations where a handoff seems necessary. These offers appear as a message prompt, such as: \u201cI understand this is frustrating! Would you like me to connect you with a human agent? Or if you want, you can share more details and I\u2019ll do my best to help you here.\u201d\nFin determines when to offer or directly escalate based on the category of the customer\u2019s message:\nCategory\nFin Behavior\nGuidance\nGuidance-based escalation settings take precedence over other categories.\nFor example, if your Guidance states to do so, Fin escalates directly instead of offers to escalate.\nRequest\nIf the customer clearly requests human support, Fin escalates directly.\nAngry\nIf the customer is angry, Fin will offer to escalate.\nLoop\nIf the customer is stuck in a loop, Fin will offer to escalate.\nNote:\nA loop is considered to be 3 rounds of replies, where a customer repeats themselves without adding additional information.\nHow\nIf the customer asks\nhow\nto speak to the human support team, Fin will offer to escalate.\nKeyword\nIf the customer says things like \u201cagent\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d Fin will offer to escalate.\nNote\n: If the customer provides negative feedback to Fin, for example they reply with \"No\" when Fin asks \"Did that help?\", they will be escalated to your team.\nEscalation will not be offered if\nThe customer asks about phone support or requests a phone number. In this case, Fin will respond based on the information available in your knowledge base, like any other informational query.\nFin has already offered to escalate in the previous AI answer. In this case, Fin will either escalate if the customer confirms the request, or continue with a regular response otherwise.\nTip:\nYou can still control and customize how Fin escalates through\nGuidance\n. Guidance that you have set will take precedence over other escalation pathways mentioned above.\nExamples of using Guidance to customize the escalation behavior\nBelow you will find some examples of how Fin Guidance can be used to adapt Fin\u2019s escalation logic. The below are only a few examples of how Guidance can be used and can be used as inspiration.\nCategory\nFin Behavior\nExample of how Guidance can be used to adapt escalation logic\nGuidance\nGuidance-based escalation settings take precedence over other categories.\nFor example, if your Guidance states to do so, Fin escalates directly instead of offers to escalate.\nFor example, if your Guidance states to do so, Fin escalates directly instead of offers to escalate.\nRequest\nIf the customer clearly requests human support, Fin escalates directly.\nYou can use Guidance to make Fin introduce some friction, so that Fin offers to escalate when a customer requests human support, instead of directly escalating.\nAngry\nIf the customer is angry, Fin will offer to escalate.\nYou can use Guidance to change Fin's sensitivity, so that Fin can offer even at slightest frustration, or escalate directly (instead of offering) when someone is furious.\nLoop\nIf the customer is stuck in a loop, Fin will offer to escalate.\nNote:\nA loop is considered to be 3 rounds of replies, where a customer repeats themselves without adding additional information.\nYou can use Guidance to drop Fin's tolerance to loops, so that Fin offers to escalate sooner than the default 3 rounds.\nHow\nIf the customer asks\nhow\nto speak to the human support team, Fin will offer to escalate.\nYou can use Guidance to change Fin\u2019s behavior, so that Fin escalates directly instead of offering.\nKeyword\nIf the customer says things like \u201cagent\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d Fin will offer to escalate.\nYou can use Guidance to trigger keywords of your choice and offer escalation if the user mentions them.\nSource links will now show inline\nFin will include source links directly in the answer it gives, so customers can quickly review the information and trust where it\u2019s coming from, without needing to scroll to the bottom of the message.\nNote:\nSources will not be shown in Fin's answers over social channels (including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook).\nIf you\u2019re on an older version of a mobile SDK, Fin will still show inline sources, but in a simplified format using numbered links (e.g. [1], [2]). To benefit from this, please update your mobile SDK to 16.3.0 (Android) and 18.8.0 (iOS).\nFin can follow up with customer conversations\nIf a customer hasn\u2019t responded after Fin provides an answer, Fin will check in if the customer has been inactive for 4 minutes and see if they still need help.\nBy default, Fin will check in with the customer, but this is fully configurable. You can:\nFollow up configuration options\nReason to use\nOption 1: Have Fin check in with the customer (Default Setting)\nSelect this if you\u2019d like Fin to handle as much as possible.\nOption 2: Have Fin check in with the customer and offer escalation to human support as part of this message\nSelect this if you\u2019d like to involve human support more often.\nOption 3: Turn it off entirely\nSelect this if you don\u2019t want Fin to send any additional messages after responding.\nThis setting will live in the Fin AI Agent > Deploy > Chat section within your workspace. It will also be available as part of Fin's settings in Workflows.\nIf the customer still hasn\u2019t replied after Fin has followed up, Fin can send a close out message if you\u2019ve configured this in your settings.\nUpdates to the Workflows builder\nThe Workflows builder is being updated to reflect these changes to escalation. You\u2019ll now see a clearer visual cue that Fin will attempt to answer customer questions conversationally, without quick reply buttons.\nThis is a visual update only, and it doesn\u2019t impact how your Fin Workflows behave. However, during the initial transition, users may experience a temporary adjustment period as they adapt to the new conversational design. To address this, consider incorporating a note in workflows to guide customers, such as suggesting they reply with specific text commands if needed.\nFAQs\nWhy are quick reply buttons being removed?\nWe\u2019re updating Fin\u2019s conversational design to create a more open and natural dialogue experience. Instead of using quick reply buttons, Fin now encourages free-flowing conversation, that feels more engaging, encouraging customers to share more context and get better, more tailored answers.\nHow are resolutions counted?\nA resolution is counted when a customer either confirms their question was answered by\ntyping a reply\nto Fin such as \"Ok thanks\" or \"That helped\", or exits the conversation without requesting further assistance.\nResolutions will not be counted if the customer indicates their issue is not resolved, such as follow-up questions or requests to speak with a person.\nHow does Fin make conversations feel more human?\nFin now uses a more conversational tone, asks clarifying questions, and responds in a way that feels natural and engaging. Fin also remembers the context of the conversation, so customers don\u2019t have to repeat themselves.\nWhat happens if a customer doesn\u2019t respond after Fin\u2019s answer?\nBy default, if a customer doesn\u2019t respond after Fin answers their question, Fin will gently check in after 4 minutes to ensure they received the help they needed. If there\u2019s still no reply, Fin may send a closing message or offer to connect the customer with a human agent, depending on your setup.\nYou have several options to customize this behavior:\nHave Fin check in with the customer (default setting)\nHave Fin check in and offer escalation to human support\nTurn off follow-ups entirely\nHow to configure:\nFor Simple Deploy over chat:\nThese follow-up settings are found in the Fin AI Agent > Deploy > Chat > Follows up section within your workspace.\nFor Advanced Workflows over chat:\nOpen the\nLet Fin answer\nstep in your workflow and look for the \"Follow up with inactive customers\"\nsection.\nNote:\nThe Messenger clearly indicates who is handling the conversation. Once a human agent takes over, responses will be identified by the agent\u2019s profile name and avatar, making it clear that the customer is now speaking with a real support representative.\nCan I still configure escalations using Guidance?\nYes, you can still control and customize how Fin escalates through\nGuidance\n. Guidance that you have set will take precedence over other escalation pathways mentioned above. We recommend familiarizing yourself with the default escalation behavior for the categories listed above. If needed, you can update or add new Guidance to make Fin more or less sensitive than the baseline behavior for each category. For example, if you want Fin to escalate 'Loop' issues more quickly than the default behavior, you can add or adjust the Guidance accordingly.\nHow does Fin handle escalation to a human agent now?\nFin will automatically detect when a conversation needs a human touch\u2014such as if a customer seems frustrated or asks for a person. Fin can smoothly hand off the chat to a real support agent, ensuring customers get the right help at the right time. This natural approach ensures customers get the right help at the right time, and you can still customize escalation logic using Guidance settings.\nCan I still use quick reply buttons?\nQuick reply buttons for Fin are being removed as part of this update, and they can\u2019t be toggled on or off. This change creates a more natural, human experience for customers by encouraging them to interact with Fin more conversationally instead of relying on rigid button flows. As a result, users tend to share more context, allowing Fin to deliver more relevant and helpful answers.\nDoes this impact Fin in other channels?\nThese updates are currently being made to the Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook, along with\nFin for other platforms\n. Quick reply buttons will still exist on email and other social channels. Other features such as product tours or buttons embedded in non-Fin workflows are unaffected by this update. You can continue to utilize these features as usual.\nCan I still use reply buttons in Workflows?\nYes, you can still use reply buttons in Workflows if you'd like to guide customers through specific options or processes. However, in regular conversations with Fin, quick reply buttons are being replaced to encourage more open dialogue.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nFin AI Agent FAQs\nDeploy Fin AI Agent over email\nTop ten ways to optimize Fin\nProvide Fin AI Agent with specific guidance\nFin Guidance best practices"},

They\u2019re tailored to help you optimize for the job your team is doing.\nInstallation\nAn installation is the process of setting up Intercom on your site or app. There are three easy ways to get set up.\nKeep reading:\nInstalling Intercom\nIntegration\nAn ongoing connection with a third-party product that helps you do more with Intercom, like keep data in sync or manage messages sent from another platform.\nJ-L\nLast active status\nThis appears on your teammate profile in Intercom Messenger to show users and leads when you were last active on Intercom. It also appears in your profile in Intercom.\nKeep reading:\nLast active status\nLauncher\nThe button in the corner of your app or site that launches Intercom Messenger. The launcher displays badge notifications so your users can see when they have unread messages.\nMost apps show the standard launcher, but you can set up a custom launcher instead. Custom and standard launchers work independently \u2014 which means if you use a custom launcher, you should manually turn off the standard launcher in your settings, or you\u2019ll see both on your app.\nKeep reading:\nSetting a custom style for the launcher\nLead\nA person who hasn\u2019t yet signed up for your product (or sometimes, a user who\u2019s not logged in). If someone starts a conversation with you in Intercom Messenger, they are automatically saved as a lead. You can also import leads via CSV.\nM-O\nMacro\nA saved response to a common question your customers ask that can launch inbox actions.\nMention\nMention your teammates by their @name in notes on conversations, so you can work together to answer questions.\nMessage Audience - Fixed message (One-off)\nA message that sends immediately to a group of people (or even just one) based on criteria you define. Depending on how you choose to deliver the message, they\u2019ll see it in their email inbox or in your app.\nMessage Audience - Dynamic message (Ongoing)\nA message you write to users, leads or visitors that\u2019s personal to who they are and what they do in your product or on your site. It\u2019s automatically sent when they meet the rules you set for the message.\nKeep reading:\nDynamic and Fixed audiences\nMessage engagement rules\nYou can add rules to any message in a smart campaign to trigger the message based on a person\u2019s interaction with a previous one. For example, you can trigger messages if people have or haven\u2019t been sent, opened, or clicked another message.\nMessage goals\nA single goal you can set for each message using any attribute in Intercom. You can see people who met the goal after receiving the message.\nMessage priority\nYou can prioritize messages in a smart campaign. Priority doesn\u2019t mean messages are always sent in a set order. It kicks in when users match rules for a few messages at once, so they always get the one that\u2019s most relevant first, and not all at the same time. You can override this, and send all the messages a user matches, whenever that happens.\nMessage seen state\nFor you and your team, this is a record of when someone saw a message:\nYou\u2019ll see it recorded in product insights, message details, and in real time during conversations.\nYour users and leads also see this in real time, in some situations.\nKeep reading:\nMessage seen states\nMessenger\nThe Intercom Messenger lives on your site or your app so customers can message you in real time and see all their conversations with your team. Any messages you send to users are saved the next time they come back to the Messenger.\nKeep reading:\nMessenger explained\nMessenger app\nAn extension of Intercom Messenger that connects it with other platforms. Anyone can build their own app based on our Messenger app framework.\nKeep reading:\nBuilding Messenger apps\nMinimum wait time\nThis is the ability to set a minimum time between messages in a smart campaign. Usually, the time between one campaign message and another is down to user behaviour \u2014 they do something that triggers another message in the campaign. But if they trigger two or more messages at once, you can set a minimum time between sending the first message, and sending another.\nImportant: at the end of the minimum wait time, the message isn\u2019t sent automatically: Intercom will check to see if they still match the rules. Their actions since then may trigger the rules for another message. Message priority ensures the best message is always sent.\nMobile Push\nA message you send directly to a user\u2019s mobile screen that links to a specific page in your mobile app. The message itself doesn\u2019t appear inside your app.\nNotification\nA notification that there is content elsewhere \u2014 a message, or a feature in your app \u2014 that you want your user to see. Notifications can appear in the app, on a desktop, or on a home screen as a push notification. You can also send notifications to users by email. As a teammate, you also get notifications when you receive a message or are mentioned in a comment.\nP-R\nPaths\nPaths are a group of bot messages and data attribute collections that end with reply buttons or follow up actions.\nPost\nA longer message designed to tell a story, a post takes over your full screen when it\u2019s open \u2014 though you can choose to notify your users more gently, with a snippet of text.\nKeep reading:\nGet started sending Chat and Post messages\nProduct tours\nMulti-page interactive guides you can design to take customers through your product step-by-step.\nKeep reading:\nProduct Tours explained\nPush notification\nA notification of an in-app message that\u2019s pushed to your user\u2019s mobile screen. It takes them back to your conversation in the Messenger.\nKeep reading:\nHow do mobile push notifications work?\nReal time messaging\nWhen someone messages you and you reply, you\u2019ll both see an update instantly, in real time. You'll also see whether the other person is \u00a0online, when they\u2019re typing, whether the message was seen, and their last active status (which will update to \u2018Active right now\u2019 or \u2018a moment ago\u2019 when you\u2019re in conversation).\nKeep reading:\nWhat\u2019s included with real time messaging?\nReaction\nA set of emoji or thumbs up/down reactions you can use with note or post messages when you want simple feedback you can act on right away.\nReply Button\nReply buttons are pre-defined choices that a customer can select. Reply buttons are used in workflows and bots.\nReply type\nControl how customers reply to a message. Depending on the audience of your message, you can choose from a text reply, a set of lightweight reactions, or a field to collect email.\nS-U\nSegment\nA saved group of users or leads you create by filtering certain events or attributes. People are automatically added to a segment as soon as they match the criteria set with your filters.\nKeep reading:\nHow segments work\nSnippet notification\nA notification style that shows the first few lines of text from an in-app message. Snippets are low-interruption. We love snippets :)\nStatus\nStatus labels and system messages that show that people are active on either side of a conversation. 'Status' includes the \u2018is-typing\u2019 text to show both sides of a conversation that a reply is being composed, \u00a0as well as each teammate's 'active' or 'away' status.\nTag\nA manually-created group of people and conversations. You can create tags and apply them to people and companies, or tag replies within conversations when a user mentions a specific issue or topic.\nKeep reading:\nHow tags work\nTeam inboxes\nIn Intercom, every team has their own team inbox to easily manage conversations and collaborate: you can assign conversations in your inbox to your teammates, or to another team\u2019s inbox. Team inboxes live in the conversations section of the app.\nKeep reading:\nWork fast and efficiently in your team inbox\nTeam profile\nYour team profile appears in the Messenger. It shows:\nPhotos of active teammates so people can see who\u2019s mostly likely to respond.\nHow soon you typically respond (you can edit this or automate it).\nAn intro to your team, inviting people to ask a question.\nKeep reading:\nTeam profile\nTeammate profile\nYour teammate profile appears in the Intercom workspace and Messenger. Intercom Messenger displays just a few key elements \u2014 your photo, an intro to you and your role, and your last active status \u2014 so people know who they\u2019re talking to.\nTeammate notifications\nIntercom can notify you by email, push, on your desktop or in your browser when you receive a message or are @mentioned in a note in a conversation. Every teammate controls their own notification preferences on their personal settings page.\nKeep reading:\nHow you and your team get notified\nTickets\nA ticket can be used to capture request details and create tasks for internal teams to handle asynchronously. Used for complex queries that take time to resolve, require investigation, multiple steps, or collaboration. Tickets can be standalone or linked to conversations and are managed from the Inbox.\nKeep reading:\nTickets explained\nText reply\nA reply to a message that lets your users and leads write as much text as they want, and include attachments and emojis.\nUser\nA signed-up, logged-in user of your product.\nUser list\nAll the people \u2014 users and leads \u2014 you track in Intercom. You can filter the people in the list based on events and attributes to send personal messages to them.\nKeep reading:\nThe user list explained\nUser profile\nAll your data on a user, updated in real time, so you know who you\u2019re talking to.

Start a new conversation in the Messenger now or email\nteam@intercom.io\nand provide Fin with all the details - you'll get a response immediately and if Fin can't answer, you can always request to talk to our team.\n\ud83d\ude03\nAdditionally, you can join the\nIntercom Community\nto get help, chat with Intercom experts, and connect with other developers building with Intercom.\nConnectivity issues & troubleshooting\nSeeing the \"We're having technical difficulties\" screen\nIf you run into the \"We're having technical difficulties\" screen as you're trying to log in for the first time, you can do the following:\nCheck our\nStatus page\nto see if we've any known current outages\nIf there aren't any outages, ask a teammate with\nComplete access\nto check your permissions in Intercom. You might not have be assigned any at sign up so adding some permissions to your account will fix this issue\nHow do I resolve issues with getting repeatedly logged out of Intercom?\nIf you or your team members are experiencing repeated logouts from your Intercom workspace, this is typically related to browser caching issues. Here's how to resolve it:\nPerform a hard refresh of your browser:\nFor Chrome/Firefox on macOS: Press\nCommand-Shift-R\nFor Safari on macOS: Press\nCommand-Option-R\nThis action will clear your browser cache and ensure you're using the most current version of Intercom, which should resolve the login persistence issues.\nWhat should I do if I encounter a 403 error when opening the Intercom Messenger from a specific subdomain?\nFirst, check if the \"Enable connection to messenger\" setting is turned on. If it's off, toggle it on and perform a browser cache refresh to resolve the error.\nFor customers in Russia\nBased on current U.S. and EU export control and trade regulations, we cannot export our software to any Customer teammates/users who are located in Russia or Belarus.\nAs a result, we are currently not able to support use of the Intercom Services for these teammates/users. If you have not already received a notification from us, please contact us at\nlegal@intercom.io\nfor further information.\nFor customers in China\nYou can\ncheck the latency\nto AWS us-east-1.\nIf there is DNS blocking on some ISPs in China, latency checks from CloudPing etc. won't help.\nIntercom currently hosts our platform entirely in the us-east-1 region. While we do use other caching services that are more dispersed, it might be worth contacting your ISP and check if they have any issues connecting to this data center.\nInstallation\nCan I install Intercom on multiple domains?\nYes. But only as long as you use the same app_id everywhere.\nIf you're using Intercom on your website, your conversations can\u2019t be seen on different domains for the same lead, as we track that using cookies. Lead cookies last indefinitely but only on the same domain. Installing the messenger on a new domain will boot but no conversations will be available.\nDoes Intercom have a Python library?\nWe host a library\nhere\n, but important to note that we have no active development work around maintaining this (it still works well in it's current form).\nLogging in\nHow do I log into Intercom?\nA standard Intercom login involves setting up an email address and password to log in with.\nYou can update your email address and password from\nSettings > Personal > Account security\nonce you're logged in:\nIssues with 2 factor authentication (2FA)\nYou or your teammates can follow\nthis guide\nto request a 2FA recovery code.\nSwitching from SSO to password / reset password\nIf a teammate has never logged in with email and password and has always used \u2018Sign in with Google\u2019 then they won\u2019t actually have an Intercom password set up. To get around this, a teammate can follow the Forgot Password workflow and \u2018reset\u2019 their password.\nThis will create a password for them which they can use for email and password logins. This will also apply to admins who do not see an option to turn on 2FA if their workspace supports it as they will need a password to have that option.\nSigning in with Google SSO (QAuth)\nYour team can set up their login so that they sign in via Google instead. Other services such as Okta can then be used to enforce 2FA on the Google log in. Any issues surrounding Google SSO logins are generally resolved through the SSO provider and not through Intercom.\nI'm locked out of my account\nIf a teammate from your workspace is locked out of their account due to too many failed email/password login attempts, you can contact our Support team in the Messenger and ask to talk to our team. We can help them get back on Intercom.\nHow do I reset my password?\nIf you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by going to:\napp.intercom.com\n(if your workspace is hosted in the US)\napp.eu.intercom.com\n(if your workspace is hosted in the EU) or\napp.au.intercom.com\n(if you workspace is hosted in Australia)\nThen, click on the\nForgot your password?\nlink.\nWhy am I not receiving the password reset email?\nIf you're not receiving the password reset email for your Intercom workspace, check the following:\nVerify Email Address\n: Ensure that the email address you are using is the one associated with your Intercom account. If unsure, check with a teammate who can verify the email in the teammates setting .\nReset Password\n: Go to the appropriate Intercom login page based on your location:\n\u2022 US:\napp.intercom.com\n\u2022 EU:\napp.eu.intercom.com\n\u2022 Australia:\napp.au.intercom.com\n\u2022 Click on \"Forgot your password?\" to initiate the reset process.\nGoogle SSO\n: If you signed up using Google SSO, you might not have a password set. Try logging in with Google instead .\nCheck Spam/Junk Folders\n: Sometimes, reset emails may end up in spam or junk folders, so ensure to check there as well.\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the issue.\nNote:\nIf the problem persists, ensure there are no typos in your email or password.\nWhat should I do if my teammate is having trouble joining Intercom due to an \"invalid invite link\" error?\nIf your teammate still can't join Intercom after following the\ninitial steps\n, delete all the invitation emails and send a new one. These emails tend to thread into one email, and it is quite common to open an old invitation link. If the issue persists, reach out to our Support team in the Messenger with a screenshot of the error message.\nTeammate account updates\nHow do I change my profile picture avatar?\nYou can change your email and other personal details like your avatar by clicking on your avatar in the bottom left corner and selecting\nSettings > Personal > Details\n. You can update your avatar by clicking \"Upload a new photo\".\nThe ideal size for the avatar should be 128x128px, less than 1MB, and either .jpg or .png format.\nHow do I change my name in Intercom?\nTo change your name that's shown in Intercom, head over to\nSettings > Personal > Details\n.\nOn your profile page, click on the \"Edit\" button to edit your details such as name or job title. You cannot edit another teammates name or update their names in bulk. Each teammate needs to edit their profile themselves.\nNote:\nYour name is public facing to your customers in the Messenger and on Emails. It's not possible to create a separate name for customers to see.\nHow to change my email if I log in with Google SSO?\nIf you've signed up with Google SSO, follow the below instructions:\nLog out of your Intercom account\nGo to the Login page and request a\npassword reset\nGo to your email client and follow the instructions for changing your password\nLog back in to Intercom using your email and newly reset password. You should now have the option to update your email address by going to your\nPreferences\nsection as above.\nHow do I change my email in Intercom?\nIf your workspace does not have SAML SSO enabled, you can update your email address directly:\nNavigate to\nSettings > Personal > Account Security\n(or\nPreferences\n, depending on your role).\nReplace the current email address with your new one.\nClick\nSave\nto confirm the update.\nHow to change my email in Intercom if I use SAML SSO to log in?\nOnce your workspace has SAML SSO enabled with any provider, teammates will be unable to edit their own email address from their\nPreferences\n. The email field will be considered as read-only.\nIn this case:\nInvite the new email address as a\nnew teammate\nvia the\nTeammates\nsettings.\nLog in with the new email and ensure all data is accessible, such as assigned conversations.\nRemove the old email address from the teammate list.\nYou can reassign conversations/messages/articles to the new teammate while going through the process to remove the old one.\nHow do I update all teammates emails because of a domain-wide email change?\nIf you are switching domains (e.g., moving everyone to a new domain like examply.com), each teammate will need to update their own email individually as per the SAML vs. non-SAML cases outlined above.\nHow to change my email if it's already in use?\nIf you are trying to change your email address via your\nPreferences\nand another teammate account already exists in Intercom with that email address, you will see an error.\n\u200b\ufeff\nIf you have access to the email account, then what you need to do is:\nGo to\nhttps://app.intercom.com/admins/sign_in\nand follow the password reset flow by clicking the \"\nForgot your password?\n\" link to get back into that account in Intercom.\nOnce you are inside, go to your\nPreferences\nand change that email to something different.\nThis update to the email address will now free up the email address you had originally wanted to update, and you should be good to create your account.\nTeammate change/update email address\nOnce your workspace has SAML SSO enabled with any provider, teammates will be unable to edit their own email address from their\nPreferences\n. The email field will be considered as read-only. Instead, they'll need to\ninvite\nthe email address as a new teammate, then remove the old one.\nThey can reassign conversations/messages/articles to the new teammate while going through the process to remove the old one.\nWorkspace settings\nHow do I enable/disable dark mode on my workspace?\nYou can enable/disable dark mode or light mode by opening your\nProfile\nin the bottom left and selecting\nTheme\nthen choose dark mode, light mode, or match system. \"Match system\" will automatically match your operating system.\nCan I control how attachments are used?\nYes, you can choose to disable the ability for customers to upload attachments. By default, your customers can send attachments (including images) via the Messenger, email, API, and Facebook.\nHow do I change my teammate's timezone?\nThe teammates timezone cannot be manually edited. We receive our geo-location and timezone data based on your last session's IP address from the third-party service\nMaxmind\n. We have no control over this data should it be incorrect, however, you can file a data correction request through\nthis page\n.\nAs a note, this means that only your teammate profile timezone is affected, as the timestamps in your workspace will show the hard-coded timezone which can be set in the\nSettings > Workspace > General\npage of your app under the Workspace name & time zone tab.\nHow do I change the timezone for my workspace?\nChanging your workspace's local timezone in Intercom is easy. Go to\nSettings > General\n. From here, select your local timezone from the dropdown menu. Finally, refresh your page and you\u2019re done!\nHow do I change the languages my workspace supports for customer communication?\nTo change your workspace's default language, or add additional languages you'd like to support for customer communication across channels, go to\nSettings > Workspace > General\n. From here, select a default language from the dropdown menu, or click\nAdd language\nto add other languages you want your workspace to support.\nHow does my timezone affect time-based features in Intercom?\nYour timezone lets us know:\nWhen you\u2019ll be back in the office if a customer sends a message outside of\noffice hours.\nWhen to\nsend your daily sign-up email\n.\nWhen a\nmessage you\u2019ve scheduled\nshould send and more.\nTimezone change will affect your\nCustom Reports\ntimezone.\nWhere can I find my workspace ID (app ID)?\nYour workspace ID (this appears as app _id in your code) is a unique code assigned to your app when you create it in Intercom. Your workspace ID will be called your\napp_id\nin your code snippets, like in the JavaScript code you use to install the Messenger.\nYour workspace ID is available under\nSettings > Workspace > General\nunder \"Workspace name & time zone\".\nAlternatively, you can also find your workspace ID in the URL when you're logged into your Intercom workspace.\nCan I edit the name of my workspace?\nYes. To update the name of your workspace, go to\nSettings >\nWorkspace > General\nand edit the name of the workspace here. Make sure to click the save button at the top of the page to apply the changes.\nUpdating the workspace name will update the branding on your Messenger and emails.\nHow do I change my job title that appears in my profile?\nYou can change the job title that appears in your teammate profile with the following steps:\nClick on your\nprofile\non the bottom left of your workspace.\nSelect your\nprofile picture\nat the top of the menu.\nClick\nEdit\nin your public profile.\nAdd or edit your listed job title.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nProtect your account with 2FA, Google Sign-On or SAML SSO\nReview actions taken in your workspace with Teammate activity logs\nIntercom pricing FAQs\nWorkflows FAQs\nEmail customization FAQs"},

Here\u2019s how to choose the best notification options for you:\nEmail\nIf you want to make sure you never miss a conversation you can get notified by email every time a customer gets in touch. Or you can choose to get notified by email in specific situations - for example, when conversations are assigned to you or a team you\u2019re on.\nDesktop\nSometimes your team will have to tackle other tasks that will take them away from the Inbox. For example, they might have to investigate a bug. It can be really hard to switch between tabs and keep an eye on the Inbox at the same time. In this case we recommend setting up desktop notifications that appear at the top right corner of your screen.\nYou\u2019ll only receive desktop notifications if you have a browser tab with the Intercom app open.\nMobile\nYou can get notified of conversations by mobile when you\u2019re on the move too. All you have to do is set up your mobile push notifications. This option helps you keep an eye on important conversations while you\u2019re traveling between meetings, for example.\nYou must have the\nIntercom Conversations for iOS\nor\nIntercom Conversations for Android\nmobile app to get mobile push notifications. Learn more about the\nbenefits\nof downloading the mobile app.\nBrowser alerts\nIf you really want to make sure a new message grabs your attention, you can tick the option to blink the browser tab every time you get a message. And you can choose a noise for your browser alert too.\nLearn more about how your push, email and in-app notifications get\ndelivered\n.\nGet notified of new sign-ups\nEach of your teammates can decide whether or not they\u2019d like to get the daily sign-up email. This helps you keep track of new customers and companies who sign up that day.\nFrom\nSettings > Personal > Notifications\n, you can select to \"Get a daily list of new signups\" for either new users or new companies.\nNew users daily summary includes:\nNew and interesting users.\nYesterday's sign-ups.\nAnniversaries.\nSlipping away.\nNew companies daily summary includes:\nCompanies signed up yesterday.\nUsers signed up yesterday.\nCompanies slipping away.\nWe have permanently removed the email addresses from appearing on the daily sign-up email, as Gmail had been marking our emails as malicious.

In other words,\ninstalling the Messenger\nIS installing Intercom. Whether you're the person installing the Messenger, or you need to meet with your developer, we recommend creating a plan for testing out Intercom internally before rolling it out to prospects and customers. This article will guide you through that process.\nHow to test internally before going live\nOption 1:\nInstall Intercom on a staging environment (as opposed to in production)\nThis option is great for Intercom customers who want to keep the Messenger completely off their production site while testing or require a thorough QA (Quality Assurance) process before setting Intercom live in production.\nThis option would require you (or your developer) to install the Messenger twice - once in staging and then again later on in production when we're ready to go live. If you have limited developer resources, the option below might be a better fit.\nYou can use this option even if you already have Intercom live in production, as you can\ninstall Intercom on multiple domains\n.\nOption 2:\nInstall Intercom in production, but only for a test segment (i.e. fellow teammates/internal users).\nIf you go with this option, you'll want to\nconfigure the Messenger Launcher\nto only show for people who match certain data. Two examples include:\nLogged-in users with your company email address\nVisitors/leads/users on a specific test page\nLet's take a look at each \ud83d\udc47\nLogged-in users with your company email address\nTo make the Messenger visible for fellow teammates/internal users, you can use the audience rule \"email address contains @companydomain.com\". Just keep in mind you'll need to have the messenger installed for\nlogged-in users and have user data passing through\n.\nEven with the Messenger Launcher hidden, proactive support messages can still be sent to customers who match the message\naudience rules\n. This means if you're testing proactive support messages, you'll want to use audience rules that target your test segment (see image below).\nIf you're lacking developer resources, you can turn on your Help Center website, and the Messenger will automatically be installed on a default domain, perfect for getting familiar with the customer experience of the Messenger.\nVisitors/leads/users on a specific test page\nIf you go with the latter approach of testing in production for a specific test page, many Intercom customers will target the page url with a\nfragment identifier\n, such as \"#intercom-testing\". This way your teammates know which URL to visit for testing, but your end users will never stumble across it.\nWhen to use the [TEST] workspace\nWe do have a\ntest workspace\nfunctionality. We recommend using the test workspace to\npractice\nsending data into Intercom. This way, you can easily delete your test workspace to clear out any unwanted data and keep your production workspace data hygienic.\nThere's not a way to push/migrate your messages or workflows from the test workspace to your production workspace. For this reason, we recommend using your production workspace to create any workflows.\nHow to roll-out Intercom to prospects and customers\nOnce testing & QA is complete, we recommend rolling-out Intercom to a small segment first, as opposed to setting it live across your entire product to all customers all at once. This gives a bit of confidence that your team has the capacity to handle the volume generated through Intercom. Here are some example user groups to consider:\nSet Intercom live...\nBy page\nFor example, launch Intercom for logged-in users on a specific product page that you know won't overwhelm your support team. To set this up, configure the Messenger to only show on that specific page by leveraging the \"Current page URL\" filter:\nBy segment\nFor example, you can set Intercom live to VIP customers or all freemium customers. To set this up,\ncreate a segment\nunder the \"Contacts\" section, and then configure the Messenger to only show for that segment.\nBy channel\nFor example, if your team has a support email address, you can turn on email forwarding first before setting the Messenger live. This is a great way to get your agents familiar with the Intercom Inbox with less pressure before starting to reply to chats.

Now what?\nGeneral process overview\nStep descriptions\nPlanning\n- define the approach you will take: who will be responsible for the migration, whether or not conversations vs. tickets will be created in Intercom, how you will create contacts in Intercom, etc.\nIntercom Setup\n- at least the basics (attributes) should be configured in Intercom in order to complete the mapping exercise.\nMapping\n- an exercise to define how entities and attributes that exist in your current application configuration will map to entities and attributes in your new Intercom setup.\nExport / Import Scripting\n(the most technical version of this step) - create the process and scripts to either pick up and convert your Zendesk export to JSON or call Zendesk APIs to retrieve contact and ticket data and to call the Intercom APIs to create conversations / tickets.\nBatch Testing\n(UAT: User Acceptance Testing) - once you\u2019ve completed v1 of the scripting, run a batch test on a subset of tickets in order to make updates and iterate on the scripts.\nInitial Run\n- when the scripts are finalized, you\u2019ll set the \u201cDelta Date\u201d as a fixed point in time to collect only the Closed tickets up to that date / time. These Closed tickets can now be migrated to your launch-ready but non-live Intercom Production environment.\nCutover & Deltas\n- When you\u2019re ready to cutover from Zendesk, which would include forwarding your Support emails into Intercom and / or launching the Intercom Messenger for live chat, now we can migrate the remaining tickets that have been closed since the Delta date / time plus any Open / Pending tickets.\nWould you like Intercom's Professional Services team to do this on your behalf?\nClick here to chat with the team \ud83d\udcac\nPlanning\nThe first question to ask yourself is \u201cwhy do I need this data?\u201d The answer will impact the structure and style of your migration.\nIf you need the data for regulatory compliance only, you might consider whether you want this data in a database you can query vs. in Intercom.\nIf you only need the data in Intercom so that your new Intercom reporting is inclusive of historical data, it\u2019s recommended that you migrate the data in its simplest form (staying away from message by message migration). The key process here is making sure that the attribute values post-migration are complementary to your new processes so that reporting is consistent.\nIf you need the data to provide the context of a user\u2019s historical interactions in order to resolve their issues today, you can still migrate the tickets in their simplest form, but this would provide the most justification if you do need the message by message migration. Keep in mind that this will inflate the overall number of API calls to Intercom by 10-100x.\nIf it\u2019s any combination of the above reasons, it\u2019s recommended to migrate into Intercom!\nMapping\nNow that you\u2019ve confirmed why you are migrating your data, the next step is to ask yourself \u201cWhat data needs to be migrated from my source system and in what format?\u201d\nKeep in mind:\nEvery ticket or conversation needs to be associated with an existing user or lead (there is a contact record for every identifiable end-user).\nWill these contacts be created as part of the migration or imported beforehand?\nThese contacts need at minimum a user_id (from your product) or email address.\nWill each source ticket / chat / etc. be migrated as an Intercom Conversation or an Intercom Ticket?\nJust because something was a ticket in Zendesk, does not mean it has to be a ticket in Intercom. We have temporal conversations that can be either chat or email, customer-facing tickets, and back office tickets - ALL of which have methods to communicate with customers on.\nTry to limit the number of different structures you\u2019re creating as it just adds complexity.\nIdentify which attributes you will migrate and what they should be mapped to Intercom (tickets & contacts).\nIdentify and plan for any potential edge-cases.\nBy the end of this phase you have a table or diagram detailing everything you want to migrate and what its Intercom equivalent will be!\nScripting\nNow it is time to review the plan with your Implementation Engineer (IE).\nThis is a chance for both sides to go over the plan and ask any clarification questions prior to creating the scripts.\nYour script will change based on whether you are pre-importing the associated contact or if you are creating the contact (user or lead) as part of the process.\nThe general framework for the creation of a conversation or ticket is:\nRetrieve the ticket details from Zendesk.\nEither search and match the requester to the Intercom user or create the user record and update its attributes.\nCreate the conversation / ticket by identifying the channel.\nYou are creating the conversation by simulating an inbound message from the customer (\nimportant for visibility in the Messenger\n).\nUpdate the conversation / ticket attributes, attachments, & assignment (team & teammate)\nReply to the conversation with an outbound message back to the customer or by adding a note\nUse this reply to post the FULL transcript of the conversation (body) from Zendesk rather than the message by message approach.\nIf you are replying to the customer and created an email channel conversation, these notifications will go out to the customer unless you are not live in the workspace or you are suppressing all email notifications (we can help you with this).\nManage the conversation / ticket state\nAll closed tickets will first go through the process of being opened, updated, and replied to before they are closed by this call. It\u2019s important here to make sure all workflows that would act upon conversations have an exception in the trigger rules for \u201cCreated via API\u201d or are temporarily turned off during migration.\nBatch Testing\nAt this point you should have a working version of the migration script setup and can begin testing by migrating a subset of sample data into your TEST workspace.\nThoroughly check the results from these tests and collaborate with your IE to make adjustments as needed.\nIf you\u2019ve purchased a migration package from Intercom Customer Implementation Services and we\u2019re doing this on your behalf - we\u2019ll only ask you to validate the results and we\u2019ll make any necessary updates!\nCutover\nHow you plan to approach migrating open tickets in Zendesk will impact how you plan the timeline for your cutover.\nDrain and Fill:\nIn this approach you would cutover to Intercom before your official launch date so that all new support requests are going into Intercom. Your support team would work out of both platforms until all remaining open tickets in Zendesk are closed.\nAfter closing all remaining Zendesk tickets is when you would run your final migration batch. In effect this approach doesn\u2019t migrate open tickets at all, but instead waits for all tickets to be closed in Zendesk before moving them over.\nLive Cutover:\nIn this approach your teams would sync the cutover to Intercom to line up with when you would run the final migration containing only open tickets.\nThis approach requires much greater coordination than drain and fill as everything will need to be repointed to Intercom as open tickets are being migrated in.\nZendesk Relevant API endpoints (for retrieval)\nTickets | Zendesk Developer Docs\nTickets | Zendesk Developer Docs\nTicket Comments | Zendesk Developer Docs\nIntercom Relevant API endpoints (for creation)\nCreate contact\nUpdate a contact\nCreates a conversation\nUpdate a conversation\nReply to a conversation\nManage a conversation\nCreate a ticket\nUpdate Ticket\nReply to a Ticket\nMigration\nThe plan is concrete, the migration script is finished and fine tuned, now it is time to transfer your data!\nKeep in mind:\nIt\u2019s important to create a \u201cRun Book\u201d (and \u201cRoll Back Plan\u201d) of the steps for both the First Migration Run (all closed tickets up to a certain date & time) and the Formal Cutover + Delta Migration Run.\nMake sure you\u2019ve thought through a plan for what components of the migrated tickets should be visible to them (and where) plus any notifications that they should receive. Usually our clients want as little impact or visibility to their customers as possible during the migration itself, but an enhanced experience post-migration.\nPost-migration, validate your ticket data and you\u2019re done! \ud83c\udf89\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nZendesk Support app\nMarketo app: Send leads to Marketo and trigger campaigns automatically\nSwitching from Zendesk to Intercom\nHow to create tickets in Zendesk from a conversation in Intercom with Data connectors\nImport your Zendesk ticket, user and organization data"},

You can\nenable a test workspace for free\non the Advanced or Expert plan.\nMany customers like to do this as part of installing Intercom to ensure messages, settings, and processes work as expected before implementing them in their main workspace.\nWhy is it helpful?\nIt's great for getting familiar with how Intercom works.\nIt allows you to sanity check your user data to see that it's doing what it should.\nSome people like to get comfortable with sending test messages first, before contacting their real customers. Setting up a test workspace can be helpful for this because it lets you test your auto messages to make sure that they are sending as expected.\nYou should use the test workspace as an opportunity to test any\ncustom attributes\nthat you're thinking of sending to Intercom.\nImportant:\nFin's AI Answers are not supported in test workspaces. In these workspaces, only Custom Answers can be enabled and used by Fin.\nWhat you need to know about test workspaces\nTest workspaces operate using your main workspace's subscription, with no additional subscription required.\nYour test workspace's products are inherited from your main workspace (e.g. if your main workspace doesn't have access to a feature, your test workspace won't either).\nTeammates and their permissions are inherited from the main workspace as well. You can't invite teammates to your test workspace, or change existing teammates permissions for test workspaces only. To invite new teammates or change teammate permissions, you have to use your main workspace. Note that teammates with Lite seats cannot access test workspaces.\nTest workspaces are separate workspaces with separate data, conversations, messages, etc. You can use test workspaces to send real messages to users.\nIt's not possible to migrate data (messages, users, articles etc) from a test workspace to your live workspace.\nIf you delete a test workspace it will erase all data within it and cannot be undone.\nHow to enable a test workspace\nStep 1:\nGo to your\nSettings\n.\nStep 2:\nWithin the Settings, click into the\nWorkspace > General\nsection and toggle on \"Enable test workspace\" then click\nSave\n.\nStep 3:\nYou'll receive a confirmation message at the top of the screen and your test workspace ID (App ID) will be displayed under to the 'Test Workspace' toggle switch that you clicked, as shown below.\nStep 4:\nMake sure to add the Intercom snippet to your non-prod environment. When you do, your test workspace will inherit the messaging abilities of your production workspace in Intercom but it will have its own workspace id (app ID), to keep data separate.\nYou need to make sure to update your Intercom settings so that the app_id field has the correct value based on the environment that your site/app is running in. If you're using identity verification, you'll need to go into your setup guide to get the new API secret for your test workspace.\nAnd... you're done!\nTo find your test workspace hover over your avatar, click\nProfile\n, then hover over \"Workspace\" to see and select your [TEST] workspace.\nReady to start testing Intercom?\n\u201cOver 2000 conversations with clients per month with a median response time of 8 minutes across 5 languages and\na 95% customer satisfaction rate\n\u2013 that\u2019s only feasible thanks to Intercom.\n\u201d\nStart a trial now\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nIntercom's workspace review process\nReview actions taken in your workspace with Teammate activity logs\nBest practices for testing Intercom and going live\nHow to create tickets in Zendesk from a conversation in Intercom with Data connectors\nGetting started with Intercom"},

You can do this by:\nSetting your reply time manually - just select \u2018In a few minutes\u2019, \u2018In a few hours\u2019 or \u2018In a day\u2019 as your reply time.\nSelecting 'Set a custom time' and then choosing how many hours.\nOr selecting \u2018Dynamic reply time.' This pulls in your team\u2019s median first reply time over the past 7 days. We calculate your\nautomatic reply time\nwithin your office hours.\nReview your office hours now\nto ensure they\u2019re accurate.\nThis allows your customer to plan their next move based on real information. For example, if your team normally responds in a few minutes, your customer might choose to wait for your response there and then.\nOr if you normally respond within a few hours they\u2019ll know to move on to doing something else.\nYou can also\nturn off reply times\nfrom being shown in the Messenger, or only show them after a conversation has been assigned.\nHow your automatic reply time is calculated\nWe calculate your median first reply time over the past 7 days, updated daily.\nIf you've set your office hours, we'll calculate your automatic reply time within the office hours you've set. We recommend\nsetting your office hours\nas this will ensure you get a more accurate automatic reply time.\nWe only use new inbound conversations to calculate the automatic reply time, not replies to proactive support messages.\nIt's calculated\nincluding\nany bot interaction times, which is why the expected reply time might differ a bit from the FRT in your Inbox Reports.\nIf you've had fewer than 5 conversations in 7 days, we'll display \"replies as soon as they can\".\nSet custom office hours and reply times for different teams\nIf you have multiple international teams in different timezones, you can add\ncustom office hours\nthat match each team\u2019s timezone.\nFor example, if your app's local timezone is Los Angeles (Pacific Time) and you have a support team in New York, you can add office hours from 6am-2pm Los Angeles time (that's 9am-5pm in New York).\nTeam-specific reply times only apply to bot messages within a conversation using\nSimple automations or Workflows\n, and not to the reply time quoted in the Messenger heading UI.\nHow do we determine what reply time gets shown to your customers\nOffice hours will be displayed based on the workspaces timezone but it will be localised to the end-User's timezone. For example lets say the office hours time is set to 00:00 on Monday New York time, it is 21:00 on Sunday in Los Angeles. If a customer writes in on Saturday in Los Angeles it will say \"open tomorrow\", as from the perspective of someone sitting in LA, it will open on Sunday.\nWhere office hours are set and the user is\noutside\nof those hours, they will be shown office hours.\nIf office hours are not set or the user is inside of office hours, they will be shown reply times.\nTeam values for both office hours and reply times take precedence over the Workspace defaults when they apply.\nTeam values apply when we are in the context of\na conversation that has been assigned to a team\n.\nTeam values are used by Workflows when a conversation has been assigned to a team. Otherwise they fall back to Workspace values for office hours and reply times.\nIf \"Dynamic\" reply time is enabled but we don\u2019t have enough data to calculate a value, we show \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\nIf you have\nreply expectations\nturned off, reply times won't be shown to anyone in the Messenger.\nHow your reply time is sent\nOutside of your office hours, the bot will send your reply time immediately, so customers can quickly see when you'll be available.\nIn simple automations\nDuring office hours you can choose if a simple automation should send the reply time right away, or wait two minutes to give your team time to respond. You can configure it for leads and users separately in the\nAI & Automation > Simple automations\n.\nIn Workflows\nYou can also send an expected reply time when building a\nWorkflow\n. Simply click on the\n+ icon\nand then choose\nShow expected reply time\n.\nManage unexpected delays\nIf you experience a spike in conversations due to an outage, a big promotion or an external event, this can lead to longer wait times for your customers.

Brands set up here are directly connected to multi-brand messenger, multi-brand email, and multiple help centers.\nMulti-brand push notifications\nfor conversational support messages (Chats and Posts) or replies sent from the Inbox are also supported. However, this configuration is not connected to brands listed on the brand page.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which brands you want to use to correspond with your customers, head to\nSettings > Workspace > Brands\nto set these up in Intercom.\nYou\u2019ll already see one brand available. This uses your workspace name and represents your default brand.\nThe name of the default brand can be edited at the workspace level from\nSettings >\nWorkspace > General\n.\nCreate a new brand\nClick\nNew brand\nto create a new brand.\nBrand name\nGive this brand a name which will be visible to your customers.\nBrand icon\nUpload a brand icon which will be used in email notifications for conversation and ticket updates.\nMost email clients will render these logos against a white background so we advise the icon / logo you upload here will display well on a white background. We recommend uploading a PNG or JPG image under 1mb.

This ensures the correct articles are visible to your customers in the Messenger and used in conversations with Fin AI Agent (including over email).\nNote:\nYou can attach one help center to multiple brands e.g. if you have a help center with parent company branding that represents all brands equally.\nFor instances where you don't need a help center aligned to a particular brand, we recommend creating a new blank help center and leaving it in the 'not live' state (this is the default status for newly created help centers).\nDefault address\nSelect a\ndefault email address\nyou've previously added, or add a new address. The default address is used by this brand as the \u2018sender\u2019 email address for any notifications, workflow messages and other automatic emails.\nThis replaces what was previously the \u201cdefault reply address\u201d (one single default email address for a whole workspace).\nFinally, click\nSave\nto add this new brand.\nNext, let your customers contact this brand via the Messenger by\ncreating a style\nfor it, and ensure customers corresponding with you by email enjoy a consistent brand experience using\nmulti-brand email\n.\nIf the wrong brand becomes associated with a conversation (e.g. if a customer accidentally emails the \u2018wrong\u2019 brand requesting support), teammates can manually change the brand for the conversation from the inbox sidebar under \"Conversation attributes\". This means their replies will be sent from the default email address associated with the newly selected brand.\nEdit an existing brand\nTo edit an existing brand, go to\nSettings > Workspace > Brands\nand select the brand you want to customize. This will open the sidebar settings where you can change:\nBrand name\nIcon\nHelp Center\nDefault address\nMessenger styles\nUsing brands in your workspace\nChange the brand assigned to a conversation\nIf you find the wrong brand has been assigned to a conversation e.g. if a customer accidentally contacted you through the wrong support email address, you can change that in the right sidebar of the conversation in the inbox.\nFor Messenger conversations, customers will still be able to see the conversation in the original and branded instances of the Messenger. The benefits of making this change would be:\nIf you have configured multi-brand email and the Messenger conversation falls back to email after a period of inactivity then your customer can see the correctly branded sender email and brand name on email correspondence.\nImportant:\nEnsure that the reply\naddress setting is set to \"Inbound Address\"\nto ensure that customers do see the correctly branded sender email and brand name. If reply address is set to \"Teammate address\" or \"Workspace address\", the default workspace email address will be used as the sender email instead.\nThe brand attribute for this conversation will be accurate so it can be picked up by search/views, reporting and workflow brand options wherever available.\nFor email conversations, changing brand will lead to that brand's default email address being used as the \u2018sender\u2019 email for any future correspondence. You can check and configure the default email address per brand in\nbrand settings\nwhen you create or edit an existing brand.\nBrand support in search and views\nIf you want to search for all Messenger and email conversations associated with a specific brand, you can do that by selecting the\nBrand\nfilter in the Inbox search.\nYou can also create an\ninbox view\nthat uses the brand attribute by selecting the\nBrand\nconversation attribute from the filter dropdown options.\nBrand support in Workflows\nWhen creating or managing a workflow, you can use\nBrand\nas a condition and to apply rules.

Teammates in this inbox will manually assign conversations to themselves or others.\nRound Robin\n- evenly distributes conversations in sequential order to teammates in the inbox.\nBalanced\n- conversations are assigned to teammates with the fewest active conversations.\nLearn more about\nmanaging teammate workload here\n.\nYou can easily view the team in the inbox and see any conversations assigned to the team.\nUsing team inboxes in Intercom\nThere are three main ways team inboxes can improve your workflow:\nWhen you are assigning a conversation, you can assign it to a team instead of an individual. Teams appear at the end of the list of teammates, whenever you assign things in Intercom. Assigning a conversation to a team means it will appear in that team's space in the inbox, so team members can pick it up and respond.\nWhen you are sending a message, you can assign replies to a team. This means that you could assign replies from product announcements to your marketing team, or replies from onboarding messages to your customer success team.\nYou can use\nassignment rules\nto assign incoming messages to a team, just as you would a teammate. This allows you to assign billing queries to the sales team, high paying users to a VIP support team, or Spanish speakers to the Spanish support team.\nWhen you need to notify a whole team about an incident, product bug, SLA breach, or training opportunity, you can\n@mention a team\nto send notifications to all teammates on that team at once.\nNotifications\nIf you have\nnotifications\nturned on for conversations assigned to you, then you will also receive a notification if a conversation is assigned to a Team you are a member of.\nBest practices to structure your inbox\nConsider the following setups for your teams...\nTiered\nImplementing a tiered team structure in Intercom will allow you to offer different levels of service for each tier, allow Tier 1 teams to triage conversations, and route customers directly to Tiers 2 & 3 based on the type of issue or customer spend.\nTier 1 teams typically handle basic how-to and troubleshooting questions, and can be responsible for escalating more complex conversations to Tier 2 & 3 inboxes. Tier 2 & 3 inboxes can also be used to field inquiries for higher spend or VIP customers.\nIdeally, an inbound Workflow can be used to route conversations directly to the appropriate tiered inbox, so that the Tier 1 team has to spend a minimal amount of time manually escalating conversations.\nRegional\nIf your support team is spread across multiple regions, it can be helpful to set up team inboxes for each regional team.\nThis team inbox structure can be used by regional managers to oversee the support reps on their teams. It also enables team inboxes to use team level reply times, which will then be shared with end users based on routing rules.\nChannel Based (Chat, Email, Phone, Social)\nThis option is best if you\u2019re directing resources differently per channel. If you\u2019d like your support team to focus on chat conversations before email, it\u2019s typically a good strategy to have unique team inboxes for each channel. This enables support reps to focus on conversations that come in through the chat team inbox first, before an email inbox.\nConversation Subject Based\nIf you\u2019d like your support team to specialize in certain topics of conversation, this is a good option to use. This is more common for support teams of complex B2B SaaS platforms, when support reps may be more productive if they focus on certain use cases, workflows, or industry types using the platform.\nTeams with no teammates assigned\nOccasionally, a team can end up with no teammates - for instance, when teammates are off-boarded or after a downgrade in your subscription. If conversations are routed to an empty team through a workflow or automated assignment  round-robin or balanced assignment), they won\u2019t reach an active teammate because there\u2019s nobody to assign them to.\nThese conversations will still appear in the empty team\u2019s inbox, but without any teammates, they\u2019ll remain unassigned to a teammate. To avoid this, ensure that teams always have at least one active member or update your workflows to assign conversations to a staffed team.\nWhat's next?\nLearn how to manage teammate workload\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nTurn on the bot inbox\nSMS in the Inbox\nAssign conversations to teammates and teams\nTeam inbox performance reporting\nRoute customer conversations to the right team"},

As a start, you should focus on:\nCX\n(Customer Experience Score) for overall customer experience.\nFRT\n(First Response Time) for initial response to a customer.\nTTC\n(Time To Close) for the time it takes to resolve an issue.\nCSAT\n(Customer Satisfaction Score) for customer satisfaction.\nNPS\n(Net Promoter Score) for product feedback.\nQuality metrics\n(e.g. communication style, understanding, investigation, following internal processes, etc.) to assess how well your agents are performing.\nBug rate\nto track the number of bugs on specific topics or during specific time periods.\nYou can get an\nAI-generated CX Score\nthat measures how customers feel about their support experience - across all your conversations, without surveys, when you use Fin. You can also use the\npre-built reports\nor create your own\ncustom reports\nto compare and track the metrics you\u2019re most interested in.\nMake improvements\nIt all starts with your north star metric: use these metrics to decide which issues are most important and will have the biggest impact on your customer experience.\nStart small, scale quickly: approach improvements in phases. Start with a specific period or a small segment of your operations and assess the impact e.g. how NPS has improved since tracking product feedback and passing it to your product team. Then scale the successful strategies across your organization.\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nHow are customer service metrics changing in the age of AI?\nStep 3: Boost your CX Score\nIf you want a complete picture of how your support performs, start by tracking your CX Score. Unlike traditional surveys, CX Score gives you complete, AI-driven insight into how customers feel about every support interaction\u2014across both AI and human agents. It\u2019s influenced by key factors like first response time, time to resolution, and the overall quality of service. Understanding and improving your CX Score helps maintain high support standards, leading to more satisfied and loyal customers.\nUnderstand CX Score\nCX Score\nis an AI-generated metric that measures customer sentiment based on the full conversation\u2014whether it\u2019s handled by a teammate, Fin, or both. It accounts for customer tone, resolution status, and service quality, assigning a 1\u20135 rating after the conversation ends. Ratings of 4 or 5 count as positive and contribute to your CX Score. Unlike CSAT surveys, CX Score doesn't rely on a small, self-selecting group of customers. Instead, it offers full coverage of eligible conversations\u2014capturing feedback even from disengaged or neutral customers, and minimizing survey bias.\nNote:\nYou'll need to be\nusing Fin\nto access your CX Score across all conversations.\nDrill into your CX Score to learn more\nTrack CX Score in your Overview report\n.\nSegment CX Score by\nAgent Type\nor\nTeammate Replied To\nin your custom reports to measure individual teammate performance\n.\nExplore CX Score rating explanations for each conversation\n.\nSee how different topics are performing\nUse the\nTopics Explorer\nto track your customer experience by topic, not just team. Each topic includes a CX Score so you can see which issues are handled well and which need attention. Focus where it matters most by identifying high-volume, negative customer experience topics and click on them to see the tree map and line charts broken down by subtopics. This enables you to make targeted improvements to the most impactful subtopics by addressing the root cause of poor CX.\nIf you want to measure CSAT with traditional surveys, you can also ask your customers for their feedback via\nworkflows\nor\nsimple automations\n.\nStep 4: Improve your first response time and time to close\nThe AI Agent era means customers expect faster responses and resolutions. Faster first response time (FRT) boosts customer confidence, while a shorter time to close (TTC) ensures issues are resolved promptly, keeping customers unblocked and happy with your service. You can use Intercom reporting to see where your FRT or TTC could use a little work and make the right improvements with messenger, inbox, and proactive support tools.\nUse reporting\nUse Intercom reporting to keep a close eye on two key metrics: FRT and TTC, and set realistic goals e.g. if you\u2019re currently responding in 15 minutes, set a goal to respond within 10 minutes. These metrics help ensure customers get the answers they need when they need them.\nTrack these metrics in the Responsiveness report\n.\nSet dynamic reply times to manage customer expectations\nIt\u2019s a good idea to use dynamic reply time in the Messenger as this will adjust response time notifications to reflect real-time team capacity and set realistic expectations for your customers.\nSet dynamic reply time in the Messenger.\nOptimize your team structure based on patterns\nBy using multiple team inboxes and conversation tags you can streamline workflows and identify bottlenecks and demand drivers. You should also keep an eye on your peak inquiry times and adjust staffing accordingly to ensure adequate coverage during high-demand periods. For bigger teams we recommend using workload management to assign queries to the right team members based on their expertise which speeds up resolution and reduces frustration.\nTeam inboxes\n.\nConversation tags\n.\nPeak inquiry times\n.\nWorkload management\n.\nWhen you start using Fin, you can\ntrack performance by topic\n\u2014not just team inbox. Each topic includes handling time so you can see which issues are handled quickly and which need attention.\nIncrease your team efficiency\nMore efficient teammates means faster response times and you can save your team hours searching for answers and support with Copilot, a personal AI assistant in the inbox. You can also create macros for your most common support queries and known issues. Teammates can use these templated replies to respond consistently to customers and automatically take follow-up actions like tagging or closing a conversation.\nLearn more about Copilot\n.\nCreate macros\n.\nBe proactive rather than reactive\nThrough outbound messaging you can get ahead of support volume and inform customers about upcoming maintenance or known issues, reducing the chance of unusual spikes. But only send critical updates to avoid overwhelming customers with unnecessary information.\nGet started with Outbound\n.\nNote: some outbound channels are only available with\nProactive Support Plus\n.\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nThe Ticket: Moment of truth \u2013 Fin AI Copilot in practice\n.\nWhat is proactive support?\nStep 5: Create an effective self-serve motion\nFinally, to really level up your customer experience, you need to create an effective self-serve motion. By allowing your customers to\nself-serve\nyou can significantly relieve the pressure on your support team, so they can deliver timely support to the customers who need their attention. Analyzing how customers interact with these resources can also surface \u2018problem areas\u2019 and prioritize impactful improvements. Start by adding public articles to educate your customers and build your help center.\nSet up and optimize your help center\nCreate new articles\nto support your latest features, products, and services.\nFormat and structure\ncontent clearly for AI and humans, using headers, tables, screenshots and logical collections.\nSet your help center live\nand allow customers to start self-serving.\nAction AI-generated suggestions\n: to improve the accuracy and depth of your content.\nTrack article views\nto identify where customers are seeking support and ensure these resources are prioritized for maintenance and/or improvement.\nCreate a feedback loop between your customers and self-serve support\nGet quick feedback from customers on the quality of your content with article reactions and use conversation tags to capture and monitor feedback (e.g. which areas of the product or self-serve resources need attention). It\u2019s also super helpful to ask teammates to submit Back-office tickets to suggest self-serve improvements when they notice them.\nArticle reactions\n.\nConversation tags\n.\nBack-office tickets\n.\nLeverage AI for efficiency gains\nAI can also use this content to respond to customers and support teammates in the inbox, ultimately saving time while improving FRT and CX.\nRefer to this guide to leverage AI and automation\n.\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nHow Retention.com got their self-serve rate to 96.2%\n.\nChoosing the right conversation attributes for your business\n.\nCreating support content for humans and AI\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHolistic overview report\nMeasure customer service with Insights built for the AI Agent era\nMonitor Fin\u2019s performance with clarity and confidence\nOptimize Fin instantly with the help of AI"},
{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/10223008-setting-up-the-inbox", "title": "Setting up the Inbox", "content": "This will guide you through setting up the Inbox in Intercom, allowing your teammates to work efficiently across all channels you support by routing the right conversations to the right people.\nWe\u2019ve broken it up into sections:\nGet to know your inbox\nOrganize your inbox and focus your teammates\nHandle any customer interaction with conversations and tickets\nBoost inbox efficiency with macros and automations\nCapture data for valuable insights and optimization\nTip:\nThis guide focuses on essential steps to get up and running in the Inbox. If you\u2019re just starting your journey with Intercom, we recommend reading the\nGetting started with Intercom\nguide before diving into the Inbox.\nStep 1: Get to know your inbox\nOnce you\u2019ve\nadded your channels\n(email, chat, phone, etc.) and\ninvited teammates\n, you\u2019ll want to decide where your incoming conversations will go, who will handle them, and how quickly. The Inbox is where this all comes together.\nSet office hours and reply times\nThe first thing to do is manage your customer\u2019s expectations by letting them know when you\u2019re available and how long you\u2019ll take to reply.\nSet your default office hours\n.\nSet your default reply times\n.\nYou can set office hours and reply times for specific teams and regions they work in when you set up team inboxes (we\u2019ll cover that in the next section).\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nVideo: How to use the Intercom Inbox\n.\nStep 2: Organize your inbox and focus your teammates\nInstead of all conversations landing in one inbox, team inboxes and views let you organize them by topic, channel, region, or whatever works best for you. You can assign teammates to handle certain inboxes, then use Workflows to automatically route conversations to their inbox.\nConsider how to structure your inbox\nWe recommend structuring your inbox by:\nChannels\ne.g. email, chat, phone, social, etc., or\nTopics\ne.g. pricing, troubleshooting, product feedback, etc., or\nSkill levels\ne.g. product basics, technical support, etc., or\nRegions\ne.g. Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, etc.\nCreate inbox views\nInbox views allow you to define a set of filters and then show all conversations that match those filters in one view. Quickly switch between views and keep an eye on urgent issues, your direct reports, or whichever conversations you consider most important. Then easily add views to custom folders to keep your inbox organized just the way you want it.\nCreate an inbox view\n.\nCreate a folder with your inbox views\n.\nNote:\nSetting up some views requires filtering by conversation data which we teach you how to collect in\nStep 5\n.\nSet up team inboxes (Advanced and Expert plan only)\nTeam inboxes give bigger support teams their own dedicated inbox, enabling better conversation routing and response times by ensuring every customer receives the support they need from the right expert. Team inboxes allow you to manage teammate workload and availability, including regional office hours and reply times.\nCreate team inboxes\n.\nConfigure workload management\n.\nSet the assignment limit for agents\n.\nAutomatically assign conversations to teams\n.\nSet SLAs for your teams to manage response times\n.\nPro tip:\nWe find the best assignment method for support teams is \u2018balanced assignment\u2019 for routing conversations to the most available and relevant teammate as quickly as possible. This still allows you to set an assignment limit for the number of conversations agents should typically be working on at one time. If you\u2019re unsure, 3 conversations is a good place to start.\nStep 3: Handle any customer interaction with conversations and tickets\nTeammates can have conversations for quick, dynamic interactions with customers, while leveraging tickets to manage more complex issues. Together, they create a streamlined workflow that keeps your inbox efficient and your customers satisfied.\nUnderstand the difference between conversations and tickets\nConversations are simple queries that can be handled quickly, while tickets are for more complex queries or escalated issues that take time to resolve, require investigation, multiple steps, or collaboration.\nConversations\nare created when customers or teammates send a message through one of your supported channels, e.g. live chat, email, phone, etc.\nTickets\nare created when customers submit a ticket form, or teammates open a ticket directly from the inbox.\nDecide which ticket categories you\u2019ll need\nThere are three distinct ticket categories to handle different use cases and processes, so you need to decide which ticket categories your team will use.\nLearn what each ticket category can be used for\n.\nCreate ticket types\nBased on the ticket categories that will be useful to you, start creating ticket types within each of those categories. Keep in mind that each ticket category has different visibility settings for customers and teammates who work on them. Each ticket type will have its own unique attributes which are used as a \u2018form\u2019 for gathering the right details. Fin AI Autofill enables you to automatically complete some of these details when creating a new ticket from the inbox and speed up the process.\nCreate a ticket type\n.\nAdd ticket attributes\n.\nFor example, if you wanted a ticket for insurance claims, you could create this ticket type:\nTicket category:\nCustomer ticket\nTicket type:\nInsurance Claim\nTicket attributes:\nPolicy Number, Incident Details, Contact Information, Supporting Documents.\nNote:\nTicket types can be edited from your\nworkspace settings\n. However, once a ticket has been created in the inbox, its ticket type can\u2019t be edited or changed.\nCreate ticket states\nAs tickets progress, they can go through four behavioral states: Submitted; In progress; Waiting on customer; and Resolved. The current ticket state will appear as a label on the ticket in your inbox (and will be visible to customers if the ticket is shared) so you can keep track of each ticket\u2019s progress. The behavior of a ticket state can\u2019t be changed, but you can add and customize the names of these states to better reflect the progress of your ticket type.\nCustomize ticket states\n.\nFor example, if you had a ticket type for bug reports, you could rename the ticket states:\nSubmitted > Issue logged\nIn progress > Investigating\nWaiting on customer > Engineer working on a fix\nResolved > Fixed\nNote:\nTicket states you customize will retain the behavior of the original ticket state. For example, if you use the \"Submitted\" state and rename it \"Issue logged,\" tickets will show the state as \"Issue logged\" when they are first created and in the \"Submitted\" stage.\nLearn more about ticket state behaviors\n.\n\ud83e\udd13Learn more:\nVideo: How to use tickets in Intercom\n.\nStep 4: Boost inbox efficiency with macros and automations\nAs your support team starts receiving a range of conversations and tickets, they\u2019ll often find themselves repeating answers and actions they take in the inbox, like assigning a conversation, tagging a conversation, or sending a response and snoozing a conversation. Macros make it easy for them to send saved replies which immediately take the appropriate follow-up action at the click of a button, while Workflows can run in the background to automatically assign, close, apply SLAs and more.\nCreate your macros\nCreate your first macros by focusing on frequently asked questions, or anticipating some of the questions you expect to receive from customers.\nCreate macros\n.\nAdd actions to automate your follow-up processes\n.\nBuild inbox automations (Advanced and Expert plan only)\nBuild inbox automations using Workflows to automate repetitive processes for your team. These can take actions on conversations (tag, close, assign, etc.) and use conditional rules or branching.\nUse inbox automation\n.\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nVideo: How to use macros for customer support\n.\nCheck out these macro examples and best practices\n.\nRead our guide for leveraging AI and Automation\n.\nStep 5: Capture data for valuable insights and optimization\nNow that the Inbox is the heartbeat of your support operations, its evolution depends on leveraging meaningful insights. By using conversation attributes and tags, you unlock powerful tools for internal organization and customer understanding. These features provide a clear picture of recurring topics and pain points, helping you identify areas for improvement. With this data, you can fine-tune your processes to ensure your customers receive the exceptional support they deserve, while empowering your team to perform at their best.\nCreate conversation attributes and tags\nFirst, identify the conversation attributes that will provide the most valuable insights for your reporting\u2014think of details like issue type, urgency, or customer segment. Next, create tags to categorize and keep track of conversations as they flow into the inbox. Both conversation attributes and tags are useful for creating\ninbox views\n.\nCreate conversation attributes\n.\nCreate tags\n.\n\ud83e\udd13 Learn more:\nVideo: How to create and use conversation attribute\ns.\nChoosing the right conversation attributes for your business\n.\nHow and when to use conversation topics, attributes, and tags\n.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nLeverage AI and Automation\n- Learn how to speed up your support with Workflows to automatically triage and route conversations, and enable Fin AI Agent to resolve queries for you.\nImprove your customer experience\n- Learn how to track the right metrics and deliver remarkable customer service with Intercom.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSwitching from Zendesk to Intercom\nGet started with Intercom Inbox\nInbox search and filter\nHow to find and view tickets in the Inbox\nReporting metrics & attributes"},

Most apps don\u2019t surface in the Intercom UI itself - they send data and take actions in products through our API.\nFor example,\nGoogle Analytics\nand\nSlack\nare apps that allow you to take all kinds of actions, to analyze your visitor data and help you manage conversations in other channels. Neither of them have an Inbox or Messenger app.\nApps in the Messenger\nApps in the Messenger are a specific type of app that make it easy for your customers to get more done in the Messenger than just chat. They are great for providing useful information in the Messenger to save your customers\u2019 time.\nThese apps are small widgets you can use in the\nIntercom Messenger\n. For example, the\nShopify app\nis an app and a Messenger app. It lets you send your Shopify data to Intercom. But it also comes with a Messenger app that allows your customers to see and search their Shopify order status in the Messenger home.\nThen there are Messenger apps that are standalone. The\nGoogle Meet app\n, for example, lets you join video calls with your customers in conversations. It doesn\u2019t do anything else, like send data between Intercom and Google.\nMessenger apps can surface in three places:\nThey can appear in the\nMessenger home\n, so visitors and users can complete workflows without needing to start a conversation.\nTeammates can share them in conversations to help improve workflows for visitors and users.\nYou can set them up to automatically\nsend in outbound messages\nto your visitors or users to help them take actions, like book a meeting or sign up for your newsletter.\nSome Messenger apps can be used in all places; others can be used in only one place.\nApps in the Inbox\nApps in the Inbox are a specific type of app that make it easy for teammates to see the right information and take quick actions to support your users or convert your leads. They are great for streamlining existing workflows and enabling new ones by bringing other services into the Inbox.\nThe\nStripe app\nfor example, lets you view your Stripe customers\u2019 account info, start new subscriptions, or upgrade existing ones. All without leaving the inbox.\nSome Inbox apps can send Messenger apps in conversations; others can only be used internally by teammates.\nNote:\nYou can see examples of Messenger and Inbox apps in the\nIntercom App store\n. Just filter by \u2018Works with\u2019.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a public and private app?\nYou can choose to create either\npublic\nor\nprivate\nMessenger apps in Intercom.\nPublic apps\nare built for other companies to use. They appear in the Intercom App Store and are labeled with your company\u2019s name. For example, the Aircall app is a public app.\nPrivate apps\nare built for use within your own company. They\u2019re not listed in the App Store and are only available within your Intercom workspace. For example, Chargedesk created a private Messenger app to help their support team share invoices with customers.\nPrivate apps are restricted to your workspace\u2014they\u2019re not accessible to other Intercom users unless you submit them for review and approval to become public. If you build a private app for your website, it will still work for users visiting your site, but only your team can configure or manage it within Intercom.\nWhat workspace permissions do I need to access my authentication tokens for the API/Developer Hub?\nYou'll need to have the workspace\npermission\n\"Can access Developer Hub\" enabled under the\nApps and Integrations\ntab of your teammate permissions in order to access the Developer Hub where your authentication tokens are located.\nApp availability\nDoes Intercom integrate with Magento?\nWe have not built an integration with Magento yet. It is possible we will build one in the future. Please get in touch and let us know if and why you would find that useful.\nIn the mean time, you might find this\nIntercom <> Magento integration\nbuilt by Zapier helpful.\nIf you're interested in building your own integration, take a look at our\ndeveloper hub\n.\nDoes Intercom have an integration with any translation tools?\nYes! There are many third party translation tools in our\nApp Store\nif you search for \"translation\" in the search bar:\n\u200b\nThese translation apps are built by third parties and will have their own subscription costs.

Invest time in creating, curating, and optimizing it.\nThis will guide you through creating your content strategy in Intercom, enabling your team to provide comprehensive self-serve support through the Help Center, as well as unlocking AI-powered support via Fin and Copilot.\nWe\u2019ve broken it up into sections:\nUnderstand the basics\nChoose your content strategy\nBuild your Help Center to enable self-serve support\nStyle your Help Center to ensure it\u2019s on brand\nSet your Help Center live\nOrganize your Knowledge Hub for AI support\nPersonalize the customer experience\nContinuously optimize for self-serve and AI success\nBefore diving in, we recommend checking out our guides for\nGetting started with Intercom\nand\nSetting up the Inbox\n.\nStep 1: Understand the basics\nIt\u2019s important to understand the dual role your content plays. Great support content powers your self-serve Help Center and your AI-powered support, ensuring customers get timely and accurate answers\u2014whether they prefer finding solutions themselves or interacting with Fin AI Agent.\nThe\nKnowledge Hub\nis a knowledge management system for creating, organizing, and optimizing all content that powers your Help Center,\nAI agent\n, and\nAI copilot\n.\nYour\nHelp Center\nserves as your customer-facing interface for self-serve support, which customers can access 24/7.\nStep 2: Choose your content strategy\nDeciding how to leverage your content is a critical first step in your support journey. A strong content strategy aligns with your business goals and addresses customer needs.\nConsider your primary objectives:\nYour audience:\nWho are your customers, and what questions are they asking?\nYour goals:\nAre you focused on reducing human support volume, improving customer satisfaction, or driving product adoption?\nYour channels:\nWhere will your content be available\u2014via a Help Center, AI agent, and/or AI copilot?\nFor most teams, we suggest prioritizing your Help Center first. This ensures you have a solid foundation of content that can later support both human and AI-powered interactions.\nStep 3: Build your Help Center to enable self-serve support\nCreating a Help Center is about providing clear, accessible information that empowers your customers to find answers and in-depth guides quickly. This is your first line of self-serve support. If you have an existing Zendesk Knowledge Base, you can\nimport public articles from Zendesk to Intercom\n. If you\u2019re starting from scratch, follow the steps below. \ud83d\udc47\nCreate collections\nCollections\nare the backbone of your Help Center. Think of them as categories or topics that are used to group related articles in your Help Center so customers can easily browse and find what they need.\nKey considerations for creating collections:\nAim for clear, intuitive collection groupings\nthat make sense for your customers such as product area or support theme.\nStart with at least 2 collections, each containing 3 articles.\nYou can always\noptimize your collections\nlater as you add more articles.\nAdd articles\nTransform your articles into actionable resources for your customers:\nCreate public articles\nwith clear, concise titles and descriptions/subtitles.\nThink about your article structure\n.\nFormat your articles\nto include clear headers, rich media, and helpful callouts for important information.\nAdd each article to a relevant collection\n.\nOptional\nConsider adding translations\nif you serve a multilingual customer base.\nAn article won\u2019t be searchable in your Help Center until it\u2019s added to a collection.\nYour articles should answer the most common questions your customers ask. If you don\u2019t know where to get started:\nLook at your support conversation history for inspiration.\nAsk your Sales or Customer Support team to think about top questions or themes.\nLook at your competitors\u2019 help center.\nCheck out this guide to different types of articles\n.\n\ud83e\udd13\nLearn more:\nHow to write great help articles\n.\nContent best practices for Fin\n.\nStep 4: Style your Help Center to ensure it\u2019s on brand\nYour Help Center is an extension of your brand. Make it look professional and welcoming, all from the settings page:\nUse the brand importer to automatically match your website styling\n.\nCustomize colors, fonts, and layout\n.\nCustomize the footer\n.\nSet up a custom domain\n.\nStep 5: Set your Help Center live\nBringing your Help Center to life is straightforward. Remember that this will be a journey which will require you to optimize your content continuously:\nSet your Help Center live\n.\nDouble-check that all articles are published and in a collection.\nClick around your Help Center to ensure it delivers a smooth, intuitive experience for your customers.\nTips:\nAdd your Help Center to the Messenger\nto empower customers to help themselves from anywhere in your product.\nUse the\nArticle Inserter app\nto send contextual links to your customers in conversations.\nStep 6: Organize your Knowledge Hub for AI support\nSimply put, your AI agent or copilot is only as good as your content. This step is crucial for enabling contextual and relevant AI-powered support.\nCreate a structured repository of knowledge:\nLearn about the different content types and when to use them\n.\nUpload a range of content types\n: you have the ability to use public articles, internal articles, snippets, websites, PDFs, and past conversations.\nCreate folders for your content\n. We recommend doing this in one of two ways:\nOption 1\n- Organize your folders based on your products and features or services.\nOption 2\n- Organize folders based on the people in your team who own this content.\nDecide which content Fin and Copilot can access\n.\nFor flexible ways to organize and group content together,\nuse content tagging\n.\nStep 7: Personalize the customer experience\nYou might want Fin to target content to certain customers. This could be anyone from your VIP customers to a specific set of customers using a part of your product. Doing so enables Fin to be even more accurate with your customer interactions.\nCreate content audiences for Fin\n.\nApply the audiences to your content\n.\nOptional\nAdd audience rules\nto control who can see articles in your Help Center.\nFin will respect any Help Center audience rules you\u2019ve applied to public articles, but you can add additional Fin audiences which can be applied to any content type. For example, you can create snippets that Fin only uses when responding to certain customers, or have an article in your Help Center that\u2019s visible to anyone but Fin can only use it when responding to certain customers.\nStep 8: Continuously optimize for self-serve and AI success\nYour support resources should evolve with your product and your customers' needs. A great knowledge base is never static. It grows and improves with your understanding of customer needs.\nUse the\nArticles report\nto track:\nEngagement and performance.\nConversations started from articles.\nSearches with no results/content gaps.\nUse AI-powered Suggestions to instantly improve your content\n.\nView the Optimize dashboard\nto see how many informational queries Fin resolves using your content, and where it gets stuck.\nAnalyze Copilot\u2019s performance\n.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nGet the best from AI and Automation\n- Learn how to speed up your support with Workflows to automatically triage and route conversations, and enable Fin AI Agent to resolve queries using your content.\nImprove your customer experience\n- Learn how to track the right metrics and deliver remarkable customer service with Intercom.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nKnowledge explained\nCreate and manage public articles\nKnowledge sources to power AI, agents and self-serve support\nEnable or disable content for Fin and Copilot\nLeveraging AI and automation"},

Developer workspaces are free and intended for development purposes only. Once you've created the new workspace you can\nfollow this guide\nto create an app and make your first API call.\nYou can create a new app for your production workspace and get the access token for the app by going to\nhttps://app.intercom.com/a/apps/{your-workspace-id}/developer-hub/\nHow do I set up a custom help center domain?\nWhen you turn on your Articles Help Center, your content is available through intercom.help by default. Your URL will look like this: intercom.help/exampleapp.\nIf you\u2019d like to use a different URL, you can create one by manually setting up a custom domain. This will involve entering the custom domain in your Help Center settings, creating a custom CNAME record, and optionally configuring SSL. Find the full instructions for set up in our\ndeveloper documentation\n.\nHow do I set up SSL?\nSSL (or TLS), is the most widely used way to secure the connection between your server and your browser. It ensures the connection between the server and browser is encrypted and safe, and appears as HTTPS.\nThere are two ways to set up SSL with Articles on your custom domain:\nUse a flexible SSL (using a third party DNS provider like CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront)\nUse your own SSL certificate (using a TLS Termination Proxy)\nSetting Up HTTPS (quick setup)\nIf you aim to switch your custom domain to HTTPS:\nNavigate to\nSettings > Help Center > Configure & Style\n.\nHead to the\nDomain\nsection.\nSelect\nHTTPS (quick setup)\nas your security protocol and save the changes.\nUpon activation, ensure your CNAME record points to\n[us.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://us.intercomhelpcenter.com)\n(or\n[eu.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://eu.intercomhelpcenter.com)\nfor EU regions) via your domain provider. You should receive a confirmation email when the setup is successful, typically within 48 hours.\nYou can configure SSL for your custom domain to keep sensitive information encrypted. If you want to do this, make sure you\u2019ve set up your CNAME with a DNS provider that supports SSL, like Cloudflare.\nFollow the\nguide in our developer documentation\nfor setting up SSL. Note that depending on the provider you have chosen set up steps may vary.\nAdvanced troubleshooting\nHTTPS Defaults to Manual Setup:\nRefer to our\nCustom Domains Guide\nfor accurate configuration steps.\nDomain Displays as \"Not Secure\":\nTo secure your help center hosted on HTTP, consider:\nUsing a third-party DNS provider, such as Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront, for flexible SSL proxying.\nEmploying a TLS Termination Proxy for advanced SSL certificate management.\nCommon HTTPS/SSL issues and troubleshooting\n1. Domain Not Secure\nVerify that your CNAME record points to\n[us.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://us.intercomhelpcenter.com)\n.\nConfirm that no conflicting DNS records exist. Only one CNAME should be active for the domain entry. Delete any duplicates.\nEnsure DNS propagation, which can take up to 72 hours, has been completed. You can use tools like\nwhatsmydns.net\nto check global propagation.\n\u200b\n2. HTTPS Setup Stuck on \"Pending\"\nCheck for common DNS configuration issues, such as:\nFormatting errors in the CNAME record (e.g., appending\n.yourdomain.com\n).\nUsing an incorrect record type (e.g., A record instead of CNAME).\nEnsure the CNAME record points to\n[us.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://us.intercomhelpcenter.com)\n.\nAfter corrections, wait for DNS propagation (up to 1 hour for changes to reflect).\n3. HTTPS (Quick Setup) Option Not Available\nContact Intercom support and ask to talk to a person to have it enabled for your workspace.\nEnsure your domain is not already in use by another Intercom account.\nVerify that a CNAME record has been added to your DNS provider, pointing to\n[us.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://us.intercomhelpcenter.com)\n.\n4. \"Access Denied\" Error\nVerify that the CNAME record points correctly to\n[us.intercomhelpcenter.com](https://us.intercomhelpcenter.com)\n.\nCheck if third-party services like Cloudflare are correctly configured. Set SSL settings within Cloudflare to \"Flexible\" or \"Full\", but avoid \"Full (Strict).\"\nToggle the SSL configuration off and then back on to restart the SSL sequence.\nThe Intercom API\nWhat is the current version of the API?\nThe current version of the API is 2.13. You can find the documentation for the API on our\ndeveloper documentation site\n. You can also change the version that your app is using in your Developer Hub by following the\nsteps listed in this guide\n.\nIf you are using the Intercom API, you can also change the version within the HTTP header of your request.\nWhat endpoints are available in the current version of the API?\nThe following endpoints are available in version 2.13 of the Intercom API:\nAdmins\nArticles\nCompanies\nContacts\nConversations\nData Attributes\nData Events\nData Export\nHelp Center\nMessages\nNews\nNotes\nSegments\nSubscription Types\nSwitch\nTags\nTeams\nTicket Type Attributes\nTicket Types\nTickets\nVisitors\nModels\nCan I trigger an article to open in the Messenger from a button?\nYes, if you'd like to trigger an article in the Messenger, you can use the\nshowArticle\nmethod\nfrom the JavaScript API. The article will open within the Messenger and clicking the Messenger back button will return to the previous context. If the Messenger is closed when the method is called, it will be opened first and then the article will be shown. This is available across all platforms in the Messenger.\nTriggering from HTML\n# You can add a link anywhere on your site to open an article in the Messenger:\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Intercom('showArticle', 123)\">Open article</a>\nContacts\nCan I bulk create users using the API?\nIn Intercom users fall under the label of contacts. There is no endpoint for bulk creating contacts using the API but you can use the\ncreate contacts endpoin\nt to create a script that imports users or\nfollow this tutorial\nwhich will give you the code samples to get started.\nBe sure to set up a\nrate limiting check\nto make sure you are not hitting the limit, which is currently 10,000 API calls per minute for each app and 25,000 API calls per minute per workspace.\nHow can I retrieve an archived user's data?\nTo retrieve an archived contact's data you first need to unarchive the contact, which you can do with the\nunarchive contact API endpoint\nif you have the contact's ID.\nThen you will be able to regain access to the contacts data through the\nget a contact API endpoint\nand their conversations through the\nretrieve a conversation API endpoint\n.\nIt's not possible to unarchive a user or contact from the UI, it has to be done through the API.\nConversations\nHow do I assign conversations to a team using the API?\nIf you would like to assign a conversation to a team using the API you have two options.\nThe first option is to assign a conversation directly to an admin or a team using the\nmanage a conversation API endpoint\n. You need to have access to the Intercom provisioned id for the conversation as well as the admin_id and the assignee_id.\nThe other option is to run assignment rules that you have already set up on the conversation using the\nrun assignment rules on a conversation API endpoint\n. You need to have access to the Intercom provisioned id for the conversation.\nYou can test out the functionality from the\n\"Try It\" feature in our developer documentation\n, the\nIntercom Postman collection\n, or in your own terminal or IDE. Don't forget to use your Intercom access token as a bearer token.\nHow do I add notes to conversations via the API?\nA note in an internal comment only visible to teammates. To add a note to a conversation you can use the\nreply to a conversation API endpoint\n. You will need to choose a messsage_type of note and a type of \"admin\" along with the admin_id that the note should come from.\nYou can test out the functionality from the\n\"Try It\" feature in our developer documentation\n, the\nIntercom Postman collection\n, or in your own terminal or IDE. Don't forget to use your Intercom access token as a bearer token.\nHow do I add tags to conversations via the API?\nIf you have already created a tag in the UI, you can use that tag to apply to conversations. You can also\ncreate a new tag using the API.\nTo use the\nadd tag to a conversation API endpoint\n, you will need to have access to the conversation_id of the conversation to tag, the Intercom provisioned id of the tag and the admin_id.\nYou can test out the functionality from the\n\"Try It\" feature in our developer documentation\n, the\nIntercom Postman collection\n, or in your own terminal or IDE. Don't forget to use your Intercom access token as a bearer token.\nHow do I create a conversation using the API?\nYou can create a conversation from the API that has been initiated by a contact (ie. user or lead) by using the\ncreate a conversation API endpoint\n. The conversation can be an in-app message only.\nYou will also need the Intercom provisioned id for the contact and the body text. Use to start the conversation.\nYou can test out the functionality from the\n\"Try It\" feature in our developer documentation\n, the\nIntercom Postman collection\n, or in your own terminal or IDE. Don't forget to use your Intercom access token as a bearer token.\nHow do I delete conversations with the API?\nTo close a conversation using the API you can use the\nmanage a conversation API endpoint\n. You will need to have the Intercom provisioned id of the conversation, your admin_id and use a message_type of \"close\".\nIf you need to redact only a certain part of the conversation, use the\nredact a conversation part API endpoint\n.\nYou can test out the functionality from the\n\"Try It\" feature in our developer documentation\n, the\nIntercom Postman collection\n, or in your own terminal or IDE. Don't forget to use your Intercom access token as a bearer token.\nHow can I set up custom notifications for when a teammate is assigned to a conversation?\nTo set up a custom notification when an action is taken, such as a teammate being assigned to a conversation, you can use\nwebhooks\n.\nYou will want to use the conversation.admin.assigned conversation topic. You can find all of the conversation topics\nin our developer documentation\n.\nYou can then subscribe to this webhook topic in the developer hub by\nfollowing the steps in this guide\n. You'll also need to have a publicly accessible endpoint URL available for the action to take once the webhook is hit to deliver the notification to your channel of choice.\nTickets\nHow do I create a ticket using the API?\nTo create a ticket using the Intercom API, you will first need to create or obtain the type of ticket to label the new ticket. Then you can create the ticket using a curl request or with a programming language of your choice.\nFollow this guide\nfrom our developer documentation to create a ticket type and create a new ticket.\nHow can I flag back office tickets so they aren't counted when using the API?\nIf you are using the API to retrieve tickets and ticket data, you can use the\nsearch tickets API endpoint\n. To exclude back office ticket types, set the field to ticket_type_id and use the != operator to exclude the ticket_type_id assigned to back office ticket types.\nIf you are using the API to\nretrieve a conversation\nor\nlist conversations\nwith back office tickets associated with the conversations and you'd like to exclude them, you can similarly filter out any results that have the back office ticket type as an attribute. Linked tickets can be found at the tickets parameter in the response or under linked_objects.\nOne other option available is to\nuse the API to tag conversations\nwith a back office ticket associated with them. You can then use the tag in order to filter by ticket category.\nError Codes and Messages\nWhat does a 403 API Plan restricted error message in a response mean?\nIf you are getting a 403 API Plan restricted message in a response this means that the API you are trying to use is not available on your app's plan.\nIn order to access the API you'll need to upgrade your plan. You can find out more about Intercom plans\non this page\n. You can find a full list of\nerror codes\nand\nHTTP responses\nin our developer documentation.\nWhat does a 409 conflict error message in a response mean?\nIf you are getting a 409 conflict message in a response this means there is existing data in your Intercom workspace that clashes with the request data. This can occur if you try to\ncreate a contact\nand there is a contact with that email address already added within your app.\nTo avoid this error you can use the update endpoint instead or create a new contact by user_id. You can find a full list of\nerror codes\nand\nHTTP responses\nin our developer documentation.\nWhat does a 429 error message in a response mean?\nIf you are getting a 429 message it means the client has reached or exceeded a rate limit, or the server is overloaded. Each app has a default rate limit of 10,000 API calls per minute for each app and 25,000 API calls per minute per workspace. More information on rate limits is\navailable in our developer documentation\n.\nTo avoid this error you can set up a\nrate limiting check\nto make sure you are not hitting the limit. You can find a full list of\nerror codes\nand\nHTTP responses\nin our developer documentation.\nWhat are the current rate limits?\nPrivate apps have a default rate limit of 10,000 API calls per minute per app and 25,000 API calls per minute per workspace. This means that if a workspace has multiple private apps installed, every one contributes towards total number of requests.\nPublic apps have a default rate limit of 10,000 API calls per minute for each app and 25,000 API calls per minute per workspace. This means that if a workspace has multiple public apps installed, each one has its own separate request limit without contributing to the others. More information on rate limits is available in our\ndeveloper documentation\n.\nReporting\nWhy is my report different when pulled from the API vs UI?\nIf you are creating your own reports using the API you may notice that there are some differences between the two reports. This can happen for a few reasons.\nOne common issue is when dates and times do not match. This is often because the time zone that you are using in your Intercom workspace is different than the time zone you are using to query the API. To fix this, either adjust your API query parameters to match your workspace time zone, or change the time zone of your custom report.\nAnother issue is that you may be using metrics that do not align with the Intercom reporting UI metrics. There are some metrics available in the reporting UI that are not available via the API because they are calculated metrics. Some of those can be created by using the API and performing the calculations on your end. Check out the\nguide for building your own reports\nfrom the Intercom developer documentation.\nAre back office tickets counted in the statistics when pulling a report from API?\nIf you are looking at the conversations reports available in the UI versus reports pulled using the conversations API, you may notice that there is a difference in the number of conversations. This is because back office tickets associated with a conversation will be included when it is pulled from the API.\nTo solve for this, you can filter results after retrieving them via the\nlist conversations\n,\nretrieve a conversation\n, or\nsearch for conversations\nAPI, and separate the tickets from conversations using the ticket field in the conversation API response. The ticket field will be populated with an object if it is a ticket and will be null if it is a conversation.\nWebhooks\nWhat webhooks are available?\nWebhooks allow you to subscribe to real-time notifications of events happening in Intercom, like when a contact is created or an incoming message is received.\nYou can see the webhooks available for each version in our\ndeveloper documentation\n. Once you've identified which webhook you need\nfollow this guide\nto set them up.\nAre there plans to add new webhooks?\nThere are no plans to add new webhooks on our roadmap, but if there is a webhook your team needs, please submit a request to the team or add it to the\nproduct wishlist\nin the Intercom community.\nPagination\nHow does pagination work?\nIntercom APIs for\nlisting\nand\nsearching\nresources offer cursor-based pagination. This is available so that when you are requesting a large amount of data \u2014 like many conversations with all of their parts \u2014 you can receive and process them in smaller chunks.\nFor examples on how to use pagination with both the Intercom list APIs, which accept path parameters, and search APIs, which use query parameters, see our\npagination guide\n.\nHow do I used the starting_after field?\nFor cursor-based pagination, Intercom uses a pointer that will refer to a specific record based on the limit that you set by the number of pages that you specify per request.\nWhen returned in an object, the pointer will look something like 'WzXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'.\nYou can then use the pointer from the response in order to make the subsequent request for the next batch of data.\nThe pagination formatting in the request differs slightly between list APIs and search APIs, but the responses work the same.\nYou can see examples of curl requests on our\nPagination page\n, and tutorials on using\nlist API\ns, and\nsearch APIs\n.\nAuthentication\nWhat type of authentication is required for public apps?\nAny apps that interact with third party workspace data and apps built with Canvas Kit require OAuth to be in place. You should never ask users for their access token and only use OAuth for interacting with their data.\nSee the documentation for\ninstructions on setting up OAuth\n.\nDo I have to use OAuth for my app?\nYou'll need to set up OAuth if you're building an integration with Intercom that accesses other peoples' Intercom data. This includes public apps that you plan to list on the Intercom app store as well as apps and integrations you will ask users to install through your own website. Learn more about OAuth from\nour developer documentation\n.\nIf you are only accessing data within you own Intercom workspace you can use an\naccess token\n.\nWhat type of authentication is required for private apps?\nIf you're building a private app that only accesses data in your Intercom workspace, you can use your Intercom access token for authentication. Find your access token in your developer hub and\nlearn more about authentication here\n.\nWhere can I find my Intercom access token?\nYou can use your Intercom access token if you're using the API to access data in your own Intercom workspace. Find your access token in your developer hub and\nlearn more about authentication here\n.\nInstalling and Publishing Apps\nHow do I build an app for my Inbox?\nYou can build an app for your Intercom Inbox by using Canvas Kit, a toolkit that allows you to build apps that work from directly within the Intercom UI.\nFollow this tutorial\nto learn how to build your first Inbox app. You can also learn more about Canvas Kit and find reference docs in our\ndeveloper documentation\n.\nHow do I build an app for my Messenger?\nYou can build an app for your Intercom Messenger by using Canvas Kit, a toolkit that allows you to build apps that work from directly within the Intercom UI.\nNote that customizations are limited to what is capable through Canvas Kit and must be created within the Messenger: it's not possible to recreate or re-skin the Messenger.\nFollow this tutorial\nto learn how to build your first Inbox app. You can also learn more about Canvas Kit and find reference docs in our\ndeveloper documentation\n.\nHow do I install my app?\nIf you visit the Test & Publish > Your Workspaces page of your app in the\nDeveloper Hub\nthen you should see all the workspaces you (as an Intercom teammate) are a member of.\nYou can click on Install app next to the workspace you want to install the given app on. This app will then be installed and an\nAccess Token\nwill be provided for that workspace so you can access its data through the API.\nFor third-party installation instructions, see our\ndeveloper documentation\n.\nHow can I publish my app to the Intercom app store?\nWhen you are ready to publish your app, you can follow the steps in the developer hub.

You should select the repository where you log issues for your product with your development team, as well as any others you would like to link to Intercom.\nNow, click\nAdd repo\nto connect a GitHub repository to Intercom.\nIf you add more than one repository, make sure to \"Choose your main repo\" at the top of the\nSettings\ntab.\nYou can only choose one repository to create issues directly from Intercom. You can still link conversations to other repositories by pasting a conversation link into that repository, or by adding a GitHub issue as a note in a conversation.\nNote about repositories\n: Each teammate will only see the GitHub repositories they have access to in the\nSettings\ntab of the GitHub app. This means it\u2019s possible for the default repository to be (or be changed to) a repository that another teammate doesn\u2019t have access to, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. You should ensure that your main repo is one that all teammates creating issues have access to.\nCreate GitHub issues from a conversation\nIt\u2019s easy to create GitHub issues directly from a conversation in Intercom.\nJust hover over a comment or note you\u2019d like to create as a GitHub issue, and click on the three-dots icon:\nThen, select\nNew GitHub issue\n:\nYour new GitHub issue will now open in a new tab. It will automatically include the conversation text, images, a link to the conversation and customer details. You can then edit this issue if needed and click\nSubmit new issue\nin GitHub to create it:\nYou need to \"Allow pop-ups\" from Intercom in your browser to create GitHub issues from Intercom.\nOnce you create the issue, Operator will leave a note in the conversation linked to that issue:\nOperator will also leave a note when the issue has been closed and re-open any snoozed or closed Conversations or Tickets linked to that GitHub issue, so you can update your customer.\nPaste the conversation into a GitHub issue\nFor repositories other than your main one, you can link Intercom Conversations or Tickets to GitHub Issues by pasting the their URL into the GitHub Issue or Issue Comment. You can do this in any repository you added on the Settings tab. Fin AI Agent will then add a note, and notify you when the conversation is closed.\nFin AI Agent won't leave a new note in a conversation if you've previously linked it to a GitHub Issue.\nAdd the GitHub issue as a note\nYou can also link GitHub Issues to conversations by adding the URL of the GitHub Issue in a note on a conversation or ticket in Intercom. The conversation or ticket will re-open when the GitHub Issue is closed.\nBETA\nAutomate GitHub Issue creation with Workflows\nIf you have access to\nIntercom Workflows\n, you will find new\nGitHub Workflow Templates\nwhen you create a new Workflow.\nTo get access, check out our\nprice and plans here\n.\nThere are three Workflow templates that come preinstalled with the GitHub app and you can customise them to meet your specific requirements:\nCreate GitHub Issue\n- creates a GitHub issue in your main repository and links it to an Intercom Ticket.\nAdd GitHub Issue comment\n- adds a comment to the linked GitHub Issue when a Teammate adds a Note to an Intercom Ticket.\nUpdate GitHub Issue\n- adds a comment to the linked GitHub Issue when an Intercom Ticket's State is updated.\nIf you do not see any GitHub Workflow Templates, you need to add a GitHub repository from the GitHub app\nSettings\ntab.\nYou can either use the default templates or edit them using the power of Workflows.\nTo edit what Intercom information is passed to the GitHub issue, click the three-dots icon on the GitHub Action step and choose\nEdit\n.\nYou can add more attributes to the\nGitHub Create Issue Action\nby editing and using the\nAttribute Selector\nin any fields: Title, Body, Labels and Assignees. Labels and Assignees should be separated by a comma and match the Labels and Assignees in your GitHub repository.\nOnce you make your changes, click\nSave\non the\nGitHub Create Issue Action\n.

But, you\u2019ll only be able to create issues from Intercom in your main repo - this setting will apply for all teammates. When you go to your\nGitHub app Settings\n, the list of repositories you see will be from the GitHub account you are logged in to in your current browser session.\nIntercom will attempt to find a template in your repository with one of the following names:\n.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\n.github/issue_template.md\nissue_template.md\nISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\n.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md\nThe first template found in this list will be used with the pre-filled information from the Intercom conversation appended after the template.\nYou can revoke Intercom's access to your GitHub account by going to your\nGitHub Application settings\n.\nHow do I change which GitHub account is linked?\nIf you remove the integration and then re-integrate it, it will automatically connect it to the original GitHub account you had authorized. If you want to connect to a different account, you need to log out of Intercom and then log back in again (and make sure you\u2019re logged into the new GitHub account in the same browser) and then re-install and set up the app.\nWhat if I have my own issue template?\nIf you use your own template for GitHub issues, Intercom will retain the template but add the pre-filled information from the Conversation or Ticket to the bottom of the template.\nIf you want to allow the GitHub app to access organization or enterprise level repos, you will need to approve the Intercom app\u2019s access to those organizations explicitly through GitHub\u2019s personal account settings.\nSteps:\nVisit\nhttps://github.com/settings/applications\n(personal account settings).\nSelect the Intercom application.\nCheck whether Intercom has access to any of your organizations and request as needed.\nHaving issues with the app?\nOne useful troubleshooting step is to reconnect your app to GitHub. In the App Store in the\nGitHub app settings\n, you can click\nConnect to GitHub\nand follow the GitHub authorization flow to reconnect the app.\nYou may also be prompted to request Organization access in order to see all of your GitHub repositories.\nHaving issues with notes not being added to conversations?\nHead over to your repository and under Settings > Webhooks, ensure that there's a \u2705 beside Intercom webhook.\nIf not, you'll need to re-authorize the repository which should do the trick.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nZendesk Support app\nSwitching from Zendesk to Intercom\nSlack app\nHow to create tickets in Zendesk from a conversation in Intercom with Data connectors\nJira for Tickets app"},

That one Intercom tracker ticket can then be linked to a Jira issue. When there\u2019s an update to the Jira issue, the tracker ticket could be updated. The tracker ticket can be used to bulk update all of the associated Intercom customer tickets.\nOne Intercom ticket to many Jira issues using back-office tickets\nAn Intercom customer ticket can be linked to many Intercom back-office tickets. Those Intercom back-office tickets can then be linked to the respective Jira issue. When there\u2019s an update to the Jira issue, the back-office ticket could be updated. When the status changes of the back-office ticket, the Intercom customer ticket is updated.\nTroubleshooting Jira for Tickets app\nDuplicate notes issue\nIf you notice duplicate notes with '[jira for intercom tickets]' in conversations, this typically occurs when both the Jira Cloud app and Jira for Tickets app are installed.\nTo resolve this, remove the\nJira Cloud\napp to prevent duplicate notes.\nGeneral troubleshooting steps\nIf you experience issues with the integration:\nVerify the integration status in the\nApp Store\n.\nIf disconnected, have a team member with full permissions in both Intercom and Jira reinstall the integration.\nTest the integration after reinstallation.\nReview\nintegration settings\nand permissions in both Intercom and Jira if issues persist.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nGitHub app\nHubSpot app\nUsing Data connectors for automation\nManually sync people data in bulk using Intercom's Salesforce app\nTickets FAQs"},

The knowledge that applies could differ depending on these factors, so when Copilot assists your team in answering the customer\u2019s query, its answer should only use past conversations that are applicable.\nIf you've\nenabled conversations for Copilot\n, this is where you can select attributes for Fin to match past conversations with.\nTarget audiences are applied differently for past conversations because you potentially have thousands of past conversations that Copilot can utilize, and they're not shown in your Knowledge Hub, so you don\u2019t have the ability to define a unique audience for each one.\nInstead, you can select the attributes that you\u2019d like Copilot to use when matching past conversations with the current conversation that you\u2019re working on.\nSelect attributes for Copilot to match past conversations with\nGo to\nKnowledge > Sources\nand open the\nFor AI Copilot\ntab.

Instead, they will see a message saying:\nAI answers are generated based on both public and private sources provided by [your company name]\n.\nCopilot answer behavior\nWhen a snippet is used as a content source in a Copilot answer, the teammate is shown a preview of the snippet source which they can open in the right sidebar.\nCreating effective snippets for AI answers\nSnippets are a powerful tool to ensure AI agents, like Fin, can provide accurate and helpful responses to customer queries. Follow these best practices to optimize your snippets for clarity and functionality:\n1. Avoid ambiguity\nClear Titles\n: Ensure the snippet title explicitly defines the product, feature, or service it pertains to. Avoid vague or overly broad terms.\nSpecific Content\n: The body of the snippet should leave no room for misinterpretation. Clearly explain the topic to eliminate confusion.\n2. Restate questions in the body\nTo enhance Fin\u2019s ability to match customer questions with snippets, restate the content from the title in the snippet\u2019s body. For example:\nTitle\n: \"How to reset your password\"\nBody\n: \"If you\u2019re looking for instructions on how to reset your password...\"\n3. Use headers for structure\nFor longer snippets (200+ words), divide the content into distinct sections using headers (H1 or H2). Each header should succinctly summarize the information that follows.\nExample:\nHeader: \"Steps to Reset Your Password\"\nContent: \"Follow these steps to reset your password...\"\n4. Utilize lists\nBreak down detailed information into lists instead of lengthy paragraphs. Fin is better at processing and delivering structured, concise points.\nExample:\nInstead of: \"To reset your password, go to the login page, click on 'Forgot Password', enter your email address, and follow the instructions sent to your inbox.\"\nUse:\nGo to the login page.\nClick on \"Forgot Password.\"\nEnter your email address.\nFollow the instructions sent to your inbox.\n5. Optimize snippet titles with variations\nInclude multiple variations of the question or topic in the snippet title. Separate these variations using punctuation such as slashes (/), question marks (?), or commas (,).\nExample:\nTitle: \"How to reset password / Forgot password / Password recovery instructions\"\nSince snippet titles aren\u2019t visible to customers, you can make them as descriptive and lengthy as needed to cover various phrasings customers might use.\nBy applying these best practices, you\u2019ll ensure your snippets are both effective and AI-friendly, allowing Fin to deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers to your customers.\nRemember to regularly\naudit and consolidate\nduplicate or outdated snippets to keep on top of them as your knowledge base grows.\nSee more content best practices for optimizing Fin\n.\nNote:\nDeleted snippets cannot be restored.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nUpload and manage documents\nKnowledge explained\nCreate and manage public articles\nSync and manage websites\nManage content and guidance targeting for AI answers"},

These articles contain detailed information that aids teammates in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and providing exceptional customer support.\nContent characteristics\nDetailed technical information:\nIn-depth explanations of internal processes, troubleshooting steps, and system tools.\nProcedures and protocols:\nStep-by-step guides for handling specific support scenarios, including escalation procedures.\nInternal tools usage:\nInstructions on how to use internal tools and software for their role.\nConfidential information:\nIncludes sensitive information that should not be shared with customers but is necessary for teammates to be aware of.\nWhen to use\nWhen there is a need for comprehensive information to solve complex issues.\nWhen training or onboarding new support team members on internal processes and tools.\nWhen documenting standard internal processes and protocols.\nExample\nTitle:\n\"Troubleshooting payment gateway issues\"\nContent:\nDetailed steps on diagnosing and resolving payment gateway errors, including log file analysis and how to communicate with customers.\nTeammates can search and view internal articles inside the\nKnowledge Hub\n, however, they can\u2019t be added to your public Help Center.\nPublic articles\nPublic articles\nare meant for your customers, and can be used by\nFin AI Agent\nand\nCopilot\n. These articles provide information that primarily helps your customers understand and use your product or service effectively and they can be added to your public Help Center.\nContent characteristics\nProduct information:\nDetailed descriptions of product features, benefits, and use cases.\nHow-to guides:\nStep-by-step instructions for common tasks and troubleshooting common issues.\nFAQs:\nAnswers to frequently asked questions.\nBest practices:\nRecommendations on how to get the most out of your product or service.\nWhen to use\nWhen providing customers with self-serve resources to resolve their queries.\nWhen educating customers about new features or updates.\nWhen creating a Help Center for customer reference.\nExample\nTitle:\n\"How to set up your account\"\nContent:\nA comprehensive guide for new users on setting up their account, including screenshots and step-by-step instructions.\nSnippets\nSnippets\nare short-form pieces of information intended to improve answer quality and coverage for\nFin AI Agent\nand\nCopilot\n. They are used to store information you may not want publicly available in your Help Center, but you\u2019d still like to provide customers/teammates with the information if they ask.\nContent characteristics\nBrief answers:\nQuick responses to specific questions.\nBug handling:\nShort notices about a current bug and advice for the customers/teammates who experience it.\nTime sensitive information:\nBrief details about an upcoming webinar, training program, etc. and how to access them.\nWhen to use\nWhen addressing common customer queries that don\u2019t require detailed explanations.\nWhen explaining a current bug or issue that should not be searchable in your public Help Center and not applicable to all customers, but would be useful for Fin to answer specific customer queries.\nWhen you need to enable Fin on some timely information which will need to be deleted at a later date.\nExample\nTitle:\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I duplicate projects anymore?\u201d\nContent:\nWe are currently experiencing a bug with duplicating projects from the \u201cDuplicate\u201d button on the project page and we\u2019ll have it fixed soon! In the meantime, you can still duplicate your project from the \u201cOverview\u201d page by clicking on the dropdown next to your project.\nPublic articles are more scalable than snippets in terms of maintenance and are weighted equally in Fin\u2019s answers, so if the information can live somewhere public and needs to be accessible to Fin, we recommend adding the information to a public article.\nMacros\nMacros\ncan be used by teammates and\nCopilot\n, however they can\u2019t be created or managed from the Knowledge.\nContent characteristics\nAnswer specificity:\nCreate a direct answer or response to a common customer query (Fin will maintain the wording and structure by surfacing the exact macro).\nMedia compatibility:\nImages, GIFs, and attached MOV or MP4 files.\nFollow-up actions:\nAutomatically trigger actions such as closing or tagging a conversation.\nAvailability:\nControl which macros are available to certain teams.\nOutbound, inbound & internal:\nMacros can be used for starting conversations, replying, and/or adding internal notes.\nWhen to use\nCommon\nstep-by-step instructions to be shared with customers.\nWhen specific phrasing is important (e.g. when handling sensitive queries or passing/escalating conversations).\nNotes to work through an internal process (e.g. a template for troubleshooting an issue).\nExample\nThe following is an example macro to smoothly pass a conversation from the Support team to the Sales team, ensuring a professional handover while managing customer expectations.\nTitle:\nPassing from Support to Sales\nContent:\nHi [Customer Name],\nThanks for reaching out to us!\nI understand you're interested in [insert product/service].

They must either be public or visible to logged-in users. Any articles that have other audience targeting rules applied to them in Zendesk won\u2019t be synced.\nOnce the sync is complete, articles will be live in your Intercom Help Center and accessible in\nKnowledge.\nWhen clicking on the synced Zendesk articles that appear in your Intercom Help Center, the articles will open in Zendesk.\nOnly one Zendesk Help Center can be synced at a time. If you want to change the Help Center that you\u2019re syncing,\nremove the current sync\nand then re-sync using the new Zendesk domain.\nYou cannot sync a single Zendesk Help Center to multiple Intercom workspaces, but you can import content to multiple workspaces.\nWe prevent search engine indexing on your Intercom Help Center if you\u2019ve set up a regular sync with Zendesk. Our assumption is that you will be using Zendesk as your primary search engine indexed Help Center.\nGet started\nYou can start a sync from\nKnowledge > Sources\nby clicking\nSync or Import\nunder public articles.\nNow enter your\nZendesk subdomain\nand choose the option to \u201cSync content\u201d then go ahead and click\nSync.\nNote:\nIf you already have articles published in Intercom, we\u2019ll keep these existing articles and you may end up with duplicated content. You can choose to delete all Intercom articles before starting the first sync.\nYou\u2019ll also need to update any Workflows containing Intercom articles with the new synced articles to ensure they\u2019re linking to the right content and kept up-to-date with changes you make in Zendesk.\nOnce the first sync is started, it's not possible to force stop it. You can remove the sync once the initial sync is completed.\nOnce the sync is complete, you\u2019ll receive an email to your registered Intercom email address which confirms how many articles were synchronized.\nAfter syncing public articles from Zendesk, the content will appear in a flat list inside a synced folder you can view from the left sidebar in\nKnowledge > Content\n. (Existing Zendesk folder structure is currently not supported in Knowledge but will be coming soon).\nPublic Articles that are synced from Zendesk will be shown in Knowledge as view-only and can\u2019t be edited. All changes must be made through Zendesk and will automatically propagate to Intercom with the next sync. However, you can\nconfigure the settings\nfor synced articles such as enabling them for Fin or managing audience rules.\nNote:\nYou\u2019ll need to import articles from Zendesk if you want to make them available in your Intercom Help Center and edit them in Intercom.\nRe-syncs automatically run\nevery hour\nand propagate any changes made to articles in Zendesk into Intercom. This includes new articles, article content changes, and removing articles.\nSyncs that run automatically following the first sync won\u2019t send an email on completion.\nWhat is my Zendesk subdomain?\nThis is the domain for your Zendesk account (not your Help Center URL). Your Zendesk subdomain is its unique identifier and there are a few ways to find it which you can\nsee here\n.\nImportant differences between your articles in Zendesk and Intercom\nThere are slight differences with how synced articles look in the Messenger compared to Intercom articles. Differences can include content formats such as, additional headings, text styling, table formatting, etc.\nIf a customer clicks the \u201cOpen in Help Center\u201d link at the bottom of a synced\narticle in the Messenger\n, this will open a new tab with the article in your Zendesk Help Center.\nSynced articles and collections are read-only and can\u2019t be edited or moved from and to collections from Intercom Articles or via the Public API. All changes must be made through Zendesk and will automatically propagate to Intercom with the next sync.\nWe don\u2019t support articles that are in any language that is not currently\nsupported by Intercom\n. If you only have one English language supported, this will be transferred to the Intercom \u201cdefault English\u201d instead of the regional English language mapped in Zendesk.\nWe only support 2 levels of article nesting; collections and sections. Any Zendesk articles in multi-nested sections will be collapsed into the second level.\nWe don\u2019t support the styles on articles that are set at a theme level on Zendesk so there may be differences between how an article looks in Zendesk vs. Intercom.\nInternal/private knowledge base is not supported by the sync as they\u2019re not public articles.\nWe exclusively support videos added through Zendesk's 'Add video' button, typically embedded via\niframe\n, and compatible with all providers available in Zendesk's article editor (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, JWPlayer, Brightcove, Vidyard, Loom, Guidde). Custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript-based video embeds are not supported.\nUsing synced articles in Intercom Support tools\nAfter syncing your Zendesk articles with Intercom, you can use them to power the following Intercom Support tools (if they\u2019re included in your plan):\nThe Messenger\nBrowsing articles\nSearching for articles\nArticle suggestions (Messenger Home)\nFin AI Agent\n,\nWorkflows\nAI answers\nArticle suggestions\nCopilot\nAI answers\nHelp Desk\nSearch and send articles in conversations\nPublic API\nRead-only capability\nUsing synced articles via the Public API\nSynced articles and their content will be retrievable from the\nPublic API\nsimilar to Intercom articles.

This enables Fin and Copilot to use only the most up to date and relevant content from these sources.\nNote:\nThis feature works with public URLs only. If the content you want to use is behind a login, Fin won't be able to access or import it.\nSync website content with Fin and Copilot\nGo to\nKnowledge > Sources\nand scroll down to \u201cWebsites\u201d then click on the\nSync\nbutton to get started.\nYou can also add website content by clicking the\nNew content\nbutton and selecting the\nWebpage\noption.\nNow enter the URL of your external support content (top-level domain).\nThis will fetch all of the pages from the website URL you provide and will read from all the sub domain pages.\nTip:\nTop-level domains will give the best results (e.g. use your external help center homepage URL\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com\nrather than subpages\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com/articles\n).\nAdvanced settings\nBefore syncing from a public URL, you can select\nAdvanced settings\nto add additional URLs, exclude URLs, specify a from date, and more.\nAdditional URLs\nWebsite structures can vary. To make sure that we sync your most relevant content, we recommend you add additional URLs for those specific subpages.\nFor example, if you input\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com/help\nas the primary URL above, you might also want to add the specific URL like\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com/help/index.html\nURLs globs to exclude\nTo exclude certain pages you don\u2019t want to sync content from, you can add a list of URL globs.\nWhat is a url glob?\nA glob is a string of literal and/or wildcard characters used to match file paths or URLs. Globbing is the act of locating files on a filesystem using one or more globs. Using URL globs also helps to get a range of URLs that are mostly the same, with only a small portion of it changing between the requests.\nFor example, this URL glob\nhttps://{store,docs}.example.com/**\nlets the crawler access all URLs starting with\nhttps://store.example.com/\nor\nhttps://docs.example.com/\nand\nhttps://example.com/**/*\\?*foo=*\nTime period to include results\nTo train Fin or Copilot on content from blog posts, change logs, news items, or any other website content with dates, you can specify a time period\u2014e.g., only include blog posts from the last 3 months. Fin and Copilot will only read content published within that period. Content that falls outside the time window (e.g., older than 3 months) will be automatically removed.\nDate CSS selector\nYou usually don\u2019t need to, but if there\u2019s a date on the page, we recommend adding a\nDate CSS selector\nfor it\u2014this helps make website syncing more accurate, especially on pages where there are multiple dates. Just keep in mind: once you set a Date CSS selector, the page will only be synced if that specific element shows up.\nNote:\nThe value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the\ndocument.querySelectorAll()\nfunction.\nCSS selectors to exclude\nTo exclude CSS selectors or avoid scraping content from specific sections, you can add a list of the selectors you want to ignore.\nThis is useful to skip irrelevant page content. The value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the document.querySelectorAll() function. By default, we already remove common navigation elements, headers, footers, modals, scripts, and inline images.\nClickable CSS selector\nThis allows for DOM elements identified by the CSS selector, to be clicked during the web sync process.\nThis is useful for expanding collapsed sections, in order to capture their text content. The value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the document.querySelectorAll() function.\nExamples are\n\"[aria-expanded=\\\"false\\\"]\", #expand_section\nComplex conditions can be also described with a CSS selector. In CSS, chaining the selectors without spaces creates an AND-like condition, for example\n.button.blue.small\nwill match only elements with all three classes.\nUsing comma (,) as a separator works like OR, for example\n.button, .blue, h1\ntargets all elements with class button, or class blue, or first-level headings.\nWait to load CSS selector\nTo target content that may have a delay in appearing on the page, you can add a CSS selector that will make the web scraper wait before scraping content.\nThis is useful for pages for which the default content load recognition by idle network fails. Setting this option completely disables the default behavior, and the page will be processed only if the element specified by this selector appears.\nThe value must be a valid CSS selector as accepted by the document.querySelectorAll() function.\nXML Sitemap\nTo access pages that might not be reachable from the initial URLs, you can enable XML Sitemap for a more robust web sync on sitemap supported websites.\nIf this option is enabled, the web scraper will look for\nSitemaps\nat the domains of the provided\nsource URL\nand enqueue matching URLs similarly as the links found on crawled pages. You can also reference a sitemap.xml file directly by adding it as another Start URL e.g.\nhttps://www.example.com/sitemap.xml\nManage website sources\nOnce the sync is complete, you\u2019ll receive an email notification and the website will appear as a synced source under\nKnowledge > Content\n.\nIf you click into a website source, you can preview and manage the individual pages that were synced from the public URL.\nWebsite sources are read-only and can\u2019t be edited within Knowledge, they must be edited at the source.\nConfigure settings\nWhen you view a website source in Knowledge, you\u2019ll find a \"Details\" panel on the right which contains:\nData\n: View the content type, language, creation date, and last update (when it was last synced with the source).\nFin settings:\nTo enable/disable for Fin AI Agent and Copilot. When enabled, the content becomes available to customers through\nFin AI Agent\nand to teammates via\nCopilot\n, respectively.\nFin Audience:\nEnsure customers only get answers and see content that is relevant for them.\nLink:\nThe public URL for this website source.\nFolder:\nThe folder where this public URL lives in the Knowledge Hub. You can\u2019t change the folder of synced content.\nMake it available to Fin and Copilot\nTo make a website source available to\nFin AI Agent\nand/or\nCopilot\n, go to\nKnowledge\nand view the source.\nFrom the \"Details\"\npanel, scroll down to\nFin settings\nand choose whether to toggle on:\nAvailable for AI Agent\n- This setting will make the public URL available for Fin to use when responding to customers (it will respect any\naudience rules\n).\nAvailable for AI Copilot\n- This setting will make the public URL available for Copilot to use when answering teammates questions in the inbox via the Copilot panel.\nLearn how to\nset up Fin AI Agent\nfor your customers or enable your team on using\nCopilot in the inbox\n.\nTeammates require access to Copilot to use it in the inbox. This can be managed for each teammate from\nSettings > Teammates\n.\nMake it available to a specific audience\nIf this website source is only relevant for a specific subset of customers, you can use audience filters to make it visible to certain people.\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to\ncreate and define the audience\nyou want to target.\nThen go to\nKnowledge\nand view the source. From the \"Details\"\npanel scroll down to\nAudience\nand use the dropdown to select one of your pre-defined audiences.\nNote:\nThe default audience for public URLs is \u201cEveryone\u201d.\nFin will also respect any audience you apply to a public URL and only use this article to answer customer questions if they match the audience rules.\nRe-sync or remove a website as a source\nIf you\u2019d like to re-sync or remove a public URL as a source, go to\nKnowledge > Sources\nand scroll down to \u201cWebsites\u201d then click on\nManage\nnext to the source. Here, you can select whether to\nRe-sync\nor\nRemove this source.\nWebsite re-syncs usually\nhappen weekly (depending on the size of the source) and can be re-synced manually at any time.\nTroubleshooting website sync\nWhen importing website content to enable Fin, you need to enter the\npublic URL\n. This will search for all pages nested under that URL and import them into your Knowledge Hub for Fin AI Agent to use.\nIf the importer didn't return the number of pages you expected, there are a few reasons...\nThe URL provided isn't the top level domain\nThe website sync works by going to the URL you provide and then searching for all pages nested under that URL. These pages must have the same URL pattern as the URL you provide.\nFor example, if the top level domain is\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com/home\n, then all pages you want to import must include /home prefix in the URL e.g.\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com/home/article\n. If they do not, remove the prefix and use the most basic URL stem e.g.\nhttps://myhelpcenter.com\n, then try the import again.\nThe URL is private\nIf the content you want to use is behind a login, Fin won't be able to access or import it.\nPage limits\nYou can sync up to 10 different public URLs and Fin will sync a maximum of 30,000 pages from each source. Syncing can sometimes fail if there is a very large amount of content on a single page (you'll be notified if a sync fails).\nIf you\u2019re using\nIntercom Articles\nto enable Fin AI Agent or Copilot, these will be available in Knowledge automatically as public articles and don\u2019t need to be imported.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSync public articles with Zendesk\nAdd your support content for Fin AI Agent\nUpload and manage documents\nCreate and manage public articles\nKnowledge sources to power AI, agents and self-serve support"},

During this time we\u2019ll crawl your docs site, import\nall of your published articles\n, and place them in Help Center collections that match the structure of your existing knowledge base.\nThis could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more.

Your Zendesk subdomain is its unique identifier and there are a few ways to find it which you can\nsee here\n.\nUncategorized content\nIf you have any uncategorized content on your site, Articles will automatically create a \u2018General' collection for you. Collections help your users browse and easily find what they need, so consider\nreorganizing these articles by topic\nbefore you publish them.\nZendesk articles redirect\nArticle redirects are automatically generated during the import process. While Zendesk and Intercom article and collection URLs are in different formats, this ensures that any existing links do not break after migration, preserving their SEO score.\nThe redirects are implemented in the form of permanent redirects (\nHTTP 301 responses\n).\nMultilingual support\nWhen importing collections and articles in multiple languages, each language variant will have its own redirect associated with the original Zendesk article URL.\nReviewing existing redirects\nAfter the import is complete, you can review the generated redirects through the\nDomains\nsection in\nSettings > Help Center > Configure and style\n:\nFrom here, scroll down to Domains and click \"manage redirects\":\nThe panel displays the original URL and the article/collection it redirects to.\nImportant:\nThe redirects will only be displayed for the chosen custom domain. For instance, if you're importing articles from a Zendesk Help Center at\nhttps://support.examply.com\n, the redirects will appear in the domain section only if you have selected\nsupport.examply.com\nas your\ncustom domain\nand you're using the HTTPS security protocol.\nIf you aren't ready to switch over your CNAME to point at Intercom for your custom domain, you can still have the redirects created when importing from Zendesk by adding your custom domain in your Intercom Help Center, and selecting the option to use the HTTPS Security protocol.\nAfter the import you can\ndelete or edit the automatically created redirects, and manually create your own\n.\nWith\nMulti Help Center\n, redirects are not connected to a specific Help Center. Instead, they are linked to a domain. This means that redirects will show up on any Help Center that is using the same domain as the one where the Zendesk articles were located.\nRedirects will be available for all articles that have been imported from Zendesk after September 22, 2022.\nContent we don\u2019t support yet\nWe\u2019ll convert your content into formatting we support (e.g. copying images). However we don\u2019t support the following formatting just yet:\nVideo hosted on an unsupported provider (we only support\nYouTube\n,\nWistia\n,\nVimeo\n,\nLoom\n,\nVidyard\n,\nStreamio\n,\nJWPlayer,\nMicrosoft Stream\n,\nBrightcove\n,\nSynthesia\nand\nGuidde\nso you\u2019d need to upload the video to one of those sites and then embed it).\nImporting from category/collection URL's also isn't supported. You'll need to import your knowledge base from the main URL.\nArticles with unsupported formatting\nIf there are any issues with importing your content, we'll add a\nReview\nlabel to the article so you can correct it before setting it live. Just open the article you need to review and read the recommendation that we\u2019ve added. The recommendation acts as a placeholder so you\u2019ll need to delete this and insert the content we recommend before you set the article live.\nFAQs\nMy Help Center has articles in 2 languages but I\u2019m only seeing one after the import?\nIntercom will import all supported languages, but we will not enable that language for the Help Center. You will have to add the language in their\nHelp Center settings\n, and after that the translation will be visible.\nI have an article localized in EN-US and EN-GB and it imported into two different articles?\nIntercom only supports a short list of localized versions of languages: Portuguese / Brazilian Portuguese, German / German (Formal), Chinese Traditional / Simplified.\nFor all other\nlocalized versions\n,\nwe map it to the closest language supported in Intercom (ex: EN-GB, EN-US, EN-AU all map to EN). In case of a clash, we create a different article for each localized version to avoid data loss.\nI have articles in Irish but they were not imported, what happened?\nWe only import articles in one of the\nsupported languages\nby the Intercom Messenger.\nThe email says it imported \u201cX\u201d articles, but I only see \u201cY\u201d in my Help Center?\nThe total listed in the email includes all the different languages that the article exists in.

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/7860255-optimizing-content-for-fin", "title": "Optimizing content for Fin", "content": "Fin AI Agent\nand\nCopilot\ncan consume all your support content to immediately offer your customers and teammates accurate and trustworthy answers.\nHere\u2019s how you ensure your content is optimized for AI support, both around creating new support content, and optimizing existing content.\nCreate new content to fill gaps\nSpot trends\n- Look at patterns among your customer conversations that an article might address. What questions are customers always asking? Do teammates have the resources they need to help customers troubleshoot specific issues? After you've deployed Fin, you can do this from the\nTopics Explorer\n.\nAnalyze performance\n-\nVisit the Fin\nOptimize dashboard\nafter you've deployed Fin to get real-time, actionable insights on which topics Fin needs more content to support, and AI-generated suggestions to automatically create and update your content to fill these gaps.\nReuse team macros\n- Go through your Support team\u2019s macros/saved replies and decide if there are some that would make sense as a\npublic\narticle or\nsnippet\n. Even if the content doesn\u2019t seem substantial enough for its own article, Fin can still use a snippet for short pieces of information that have no other obvious home.\nPro tip:\nAdd an article with all the details your customers might need to get in touch with your team. While it might seem counter-intuitive, our user testing shows if customers know they can get help from an actual support rep when they need it \u2013 via email, live chat, social platforms, etc. \u2013 they\u2019re more willing to look for an answer on their own first.\nThis approach reduces conversation volume for support agents so they have the time to provide valuable human support for high-value and complex queries, like billing queries and emotionally-charged complaints.\nOptimize and update existing content\nThe more simple, straightforward, and comprehensive your articles are, the easier it will be for AI (and humans!) to consume them. If it\u2019s confusing for a human to read, it\u2019ll be confusing for an AI agent or copilot as well. Focus on:\nSimplifying language\n: Think about how your users frame questions and ensure that the answer is phrased in a relevant and accessible way. Avoid basic \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers; instead, use full sentences to disambiguate the answer for AI.\nCreating a scannable structure:\nStructuring your content in a more streamlined way not only helps humans, but AI too. Use\nrich formatting\nsuch as headings, tables, and bullet points to make it easier for AI to scan and retrieve the answer your customer or teammate is looking for.\nIdentifying who the content is aimed at\n: If you have a variety of user types, and your support content differs for each one, ensure that each piece of content includes a clear reference to the type of user the content is geared towards.\nTip:\nUse\naudience rules\nto target content at specific customer segments.\nAuditing for accuracy\n: From sales and engineering, to legal and security - knowledge can be created by multiple teams and subject matter experts (SMEs). So divide your content by owner and ask each team or SME to review their knowledge area.\nExplaining key terms\n: Explain the meaning of special terms or spell out acronyms the first time you use them, even if you think your audience already knows what they mean.\nPrioritize the most important updates\nHere are some tips to help you decide what to address first:\nSort your content by \u2018Last updated\u2019 to find the content most likely to contain outdated information.\nIdentify the high-traffic articles in your Help Center (based on metrics like views and conversations started from articles), and make them as straightforward and informative as you can.\nOnce you've deployed Fin, use the\nOptimize dashboard\nto discover topics which are driving a high volume of conversations with low CX Scores and\nreview the suggestions\nto improve Fin\u2019s performance.\nNot all inaccuracies in your support content are created equal. Updating content to reflect minor aesthetic edits to your product or internal workflows is less urgent than updating with more major functional or usability changes to your product or service offering.\nExamples of Best Practice\nThe following Best Practices use public articles as an example, however they can be applied to all content in\nKnowledge\nwhich is enabled for AI (including internal articles, snippets, and synced or external sources).\nAvoid ambiguity\nIf it\u2019s confusing or ambiguous for a human to read, it\u2019s also going to be ambiguous for AI! (And that\u2019s when there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll give the wrong answer, or make an incorrect inference, or just not answer something that otherwise should be answerable).\nGood practice\nCollaborating on projects is easier when you invite teammates to join your team.\nPoor practice\nIt\u2019s easier when you invite teammates.\nRestate questions\nYou don\u2019t need to do a question-answer pair, but write as if you\u2019re doing a radio interview and you don\u2019t want to be quoted out of context.\nGood practice\nYou can use your own packaging when sending an item back for a return or exchange, no need to save the original shipping box.\nPoor practice\nDo I need to use the original outer shipping box to ship back a return item?\nNo.\nUse headers\nIt\u2019s important to use headers (H1, H2, or H3) to make your content scannable for both AI and humans. But you should also include some of the header information in the paragraph below it, just in case Fin or Copilot fails to properly capture all the headings in the HTML.\nGood practice\nCheck out as a guest\nTo check out as a guest, click \u2018Checkout as guest\u2019 and enter your email address. We\u2019ll need this to confirm your order and update you on shipping.\nCheck out as a logged in user\nTo check out as a logged in user, sign in or create a new account by clicking \u2018Sign in\u2019 at checkout. This lets you collect points and keep all your orders in one place.\nPoor practice\nChecking out can be done as a guest or logged in user.\nClick \u2018Checkout as guest\u2019 and enter your email address. We\u2019ll need this to confirm your order and update you on shipping. You can also sign in or create a new account by clicking \u2018Sign in\u2019 at checkout.\nUse bulleted lists\nAI performs better when long, detailed paragraphs are formatted using clear bulleted lists instead.\nGood practice\nUse Projects to:\nCreate and manage tasks in one place.\nGet a clear overview of timelines and stay on track.\nCollaborate efficiently with your whole team.\nPoor practice\nYou can do lots of things with Projects, like creating and managing tasks, getting an overview of timelines to stay on track, and collaborating efficiently with your whole team.\nDon\u2019t ask Fin to do math\nFor example, if you have a complicated returns process with many moving parts, you should explain each moving part carefully. If you do want Fin to handle questions which may involve some math, it's helpful to include examples which clearly showing how the sum can be calculated.\nGood practice\nReturns can take up to 12 business days to post to your account. This is because the shipment may take up to 7 days to arrive at our warehouse, and 5 additional days to be processed.\nIf you don\u2019t see the return status updated in your account and it\u2019s been more than 12 business days, please ask to speak to a human.\nIf your return has been posted to your account but you\u2019re waiting for your refund to appear on your payment method, please know it could take up to 5 additional business days for it to appear.\nPoor practice\nRefunds for returns can take 7 days for the shipment to arrive, and then 5 days to process the refund, and 5 more days for the refund to be credited to your account.\nInclude contact details\nIf certain numbers/addresses are specific to a particular situation, just clearly delineate them.\nGood practice\nContact Sales team: 018 4366891\nContact Support team: 018 4366892\nAdvertise with us: 018 4366893\nPoor practice\nContact us\nSales: 018 4366891\nSupport: 018 4366892\nAdvertising: 018 4366893\nUse FAQ articles or snippets\nAn AI agent drives the most value when it resolves high volume, repetitive questions. So if you have small pieces of information that don\u2019t require a full article or have no other obvious home, you should include them as a list of FAQs in one\npublic\n/\ninternal\narticle or create\nsnippets\n. Fin will still be able to find them and serve them to customers.\nGood practice\nCan I have a free trial?\nYes, all new customers get a 1 month free trial after signing up.\nDo I need to upload a profile picture for my pet?\nNo, you don\u2019t need to upload a profile picture for your pets, but we\u2019d love to see them!\nPoor practice\nExcluding this information from your support content and missing out on some easy resolutions.\nWhen setting up FAQ articles it is strongly recommended to use headers (H1, H2, H3) when structuring your FAQs.\nGive context to multimedia\nFin and Copilot can't use images and videos from your support content (yet!) So if you have included multimedia in your support content, it's important to also include step-by-step text instructions above or below any image or video which guides the user through the process.\nBonus:\nthis makes your content more accessible to visually impaired users while also catering for multi-mode learners.\nGood practice\nTo create new projects, just follow these steps:\nFrom your dashboard, navigate to your projects page and\nclick the plus icon (+)\nin the top left of your toolbar.\nAdd a project name\n. Make sure it's clear and explains what the project is about at a glance.\nSuccess!\nYour project will now be visible on your \"My Projects\" page.\nPoor practice\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nAdd your support content for Fin AI Agent\nEnable or disable content for Fin and Copilot\nTop ten ways to optimize Fin\nCreating content for self-serve and AI-powered support\nOptimize Fin instantly with the help of AI"},

The available data attributes for filtering depend on the\ndatasets\nfrom which the metric is derived.\nTo learn more about the available attributes for each metric, and their corresponding definitions, see\nUnderstanding reporting datasets\n.\nSortable\n: Click on a column name to sort and group the data in the table. Attributes from a list format, like \"channel,\" are grouped and sorted by their list ID instead of alphabetically. For columns with multiple values, such as conversation tags, sorting is based on the first value in the list.\nAdd/Remove Columns\n: Use the\ncolumns\nbutton on the top right to customize the table's columns. By default, the table displays the ID, timestamp, and metric value (if applicable), along with any attributes used for viewing or segmenting in the chart. Column preferences are saved at the chart level.\nConversation Preview\n: Gain immediate insights by viewing conversations directly from the drill-in table. Click on the\nConversation ID\nor\nConversation Action ID\nlink to access a specific conversation part, taking you directly to the relevant action within a conversation.\nNote:\nWhen you add filter conditions combined with \"OR\" at the report level, these conditions will default to \"AND\" in the chat-drill feature. This is because displaying multiple logical operators simultaneously is not supported.\nExport to CSV\nChart-drill in also enables you to export the data behind a chart for further exploration and analysis outside of Intercom. Once you click\nExport CSV\n,\nthe file will download right to your browser.\nThe export button will only be enabled when there are 10,000 or less rows to be exported.\nOnly the columns visible in the drill-in table will be exported to the CSV file. You can adjust which columns are visible by clicking the column icon and selecting the columns you want to export \ud83d\udc47\nFAQs\nWhy is the conversation data export marked as \u201clegacy\u201d?\nThis is our original export feature that only exports conversation level data.

This is shown in the CSV column header for columns that are date specific.\nWhy are dates formatted differently in the CSV export than in the chart drill-in?\nThe format used in the CSV is more easily parsed by spreadsheet applications.\nWhy isn\u2019t chart drill-in available on legacy pre-built reports?\nThe chart drill-in feature is only available on new\nreport templates\nand\ncustom reports\n.\nWhy are there more rows in the chart drill-in compared to the value I see in the chart?\nThe difference in the number of rows in the chart drill-in compared to the chart value occurs because some metrics, especially those from the\nConversation actions dataset\n, are calculated based on unique conversations. For instance, the metric for \"Closed conversations\" shows the count of unique conversations that were closed in a specific time period. However, each conversation may have several close actions. Therefore, in the chart drill-in, if a conversation has been closed multiple times, it is displayed as one row per close action.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nExport your tickets data\nHow to use teammate filters in reports\nCustom report chart types and options\nReporting FAQs\nCopilot reporting"},

You can see how many leads your team create, how fast they reply, which messages convert the most visitors to leads and how many leads your team send to Salesforce.\nBelow, we\u2019ll show you how to use your leads report to help you capture and convert higher quality leads.\nView the leads report\nYou'll find the leads report in\nReports > All reports > Intercom reports\n.\nNote:\nThis is a legacy report and isn't customizable.\nOpen the report and filter it by any date range, up to a year.\nTrack your lead generation\nSee how many leads your team generate through the Intercom Messenger over time. The\nNew leads from Intercom Messenger\nchart includes leads generated from new inbound conversations and replies to your\nongoing messages\n.\nCapture more, higher quality leads\nFocus your team\u2019s efforts on converting leads during the days that generate the most leads for your business. For example, if your team typically generate more leads Tuesday to Thursday, make sure they\u2019re available to respond to your lead\u2019s messages on those days. Then, if there\u2019s usually a drop-off on other days, like Monday and Friday, your team can focus on other outreach activities, like calling prospects.\nYou can help your team manage more leads by\nusing Workflows to qualify your leads\nfor you.\nRespond to your leads quickly\nIf you want to convert more visitors into leads, it's critical you respond to them quickly before they leave your site. You can ensure you\u2019re not missing out on promising leads by checking how quickly your team responds:\nPro tip:\nWe recommend trying to reply to leads within 3 minutes. This response time will ensure they don\u2019t drop off your site before you get a chance to chat to them and convert them. To help you reply promptly, create a macro, and customize it for every lead you send it to.\nHow is my team\u2019s median response time calculated?\nMedian response time is calculated by taking the middle value in all of your response times. The middle value is what separates the higher half from the lower half of your total response times. For example, if you have 5 response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, your median response time is 4 minutes (the middle value). We recommend calculating your team\u2019s response metrics\nwithin office hours only\n.\nGenerate more leads from live chat\nIt\u2019s easy to see which message types, such as inbound conversations or\nongoing messages to visitors\n, convert the most leads over time. Then, you can review your best performers and apply what\u2019s working to the rest of your messages.\nTweak your messages to capture and engage high quality leads\nCreating highly targeted, relevant messages is key to generating more leads for your business. Here are our four best pieces of advice on how can optimize your messages to win more leads:\nMake sure\nmessages to your visitors\nare short and relevant to the page they appear on. Include a GIF or emoji to make them more engaging.\nTweak your less effective messages by changing the content or message timing to improve their performance. We strongly recommend\nA/B testing your message\nwhen you've got competing theories as to what might work best.\nAutomatically qualify your leads using\nWorkflows\n, so you can generate high quality leads across all of your messages.\nIf you\u2019re low on new leads, maybe your leads are leaving your site before they see your message. It\u2019s important to reach out, and offer help in a timely manner. For example, try decreasing the \u2018time on page\u2019 rule that triggers your visitor auto messages.\nSend qualified leads to Salesforce\nIf you\nintegrate Salesforce with Intercom\n, you can see how many leads your team are sending to Salesforce:\nThis includes leads Intercom automations (like Workflows) automatically sent to Salesforce and leads your teammates manually sent to Salesforce.\nSend more, high quality leads to Salesforce\nYou should streamline your sales workflow when you integrate Salesforce and Intercom. Here are some ways to improve how you manage your leads:\nIf you only send your\nqualified leads\nto Salesforce, you\u2019ll be able to see what percentage of your leads your team qualify, by comparing this graph with the \u2018New leads from the Intercom Messenger\u2019 graph.\nIf you think a lead is a good fit for your business but they\u2019ve yet to reply, add them to Salesforce. Then\nsnooze the conversation in Intercom\nuntil a specific date to remind yourself to follow up with them.\nIf your team are sending a low number of your leads to Salesforce, this may indicate that you need to improve the quality of your leads by\ntweaking your qualification criteria\n.\nYou should regularly review your messages to ensure they\u2019re effectively targeting visitors and converting them into leads.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nReal-time messaging explained\nHow do visitors, leads and users work in Intercom?\nGenerating leads with Intercom\nResponsiveness reporting\nEffectiveness reporting"},

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8921906-reporting-faqs", "title": "Reporting FAQs", "content": "Creating reports\nAre all report templates available on all plans?\nNot all report templates are available on all plans:\nThe Conversations report template requires the\nConversations report\nfeature.\nThe Team Inbox & Teammate Performance report templates require the\nTeam performance report\nfeature.\nCan I create reports if my plan doesn't include custom reports?\nYes, all customers can create reports. However, if you don't have custom reports included on your plan you can only add charts from the chart library (you can't create your own custom charts).\nNote:\nYou'll need \"Can access Reports\"\npermission\non your workspace.\nWhat is the difference between a custom chart and a pre-built chart?\nCustom charts are those created or edited via the chart builder. A chart you add from the chart library is a pre-built chart. Editing and saving any changes to a pre-built chart will make it a custom chart. If you downgrade from a plan that includes custom reports to one that doesn\u2019t, any custom charts you\u2019ve created will be inaccessible.\nNote:\nBuilding custom charts requires access custom reports on\nyour plan\n.\nWhat is the difference between view mode and edit mode?\nAny changes made to a report such as applying filters will not be saved unless you do so in edit mode and then save them. Changes made in view mode will be cleared when the you reload the browser.\nLegacy pre-built reports automatically remembered your last filter selections through the browser. This means when you returned to a report, you would see the same date and attribute filters as during their last visit. The new reports do not retain these selections.\nYou can edit or duplicate a report and save your preferred filter selections to ensure these settings persist for future views.\nWhy can't I make some charts smaller on my report?\nEach chart type has minimum sizes (in grid sizes WxH). They are as follows:\nColumn: 3x4\nKPI: 2x2\nHeatmap: 4x4\nTable: 3x4\nLine: 3x4\nHorizontal Bar: 3x2\nArea: 3x4\nDonut: 2x5\nWhy are some charts missing from the report templates?\nIntercom's legacy prebuilt reports contained charts which used versions of metrics and filters that aren\u2019t possible to replicate in our new report templates, or they presented results that are replicable in custom reporting. New report templates now use the same metrics, filters, and chart types as custom reports, so every chart can be replicated in custom reports.\nLearn how reporting metrics and attributes are defined in Intercom\n.\nWhat is an aggregation?\nAn aggregation is how all the different values from individual conversations are combined and presented as a single number.\nFor example, taking the different response times from each reply in all your conversations and aggregating them to show you the \u2018median\u2019 response time.\nHow are aggregations calculated?\nAverage\nis the total of all values divided by the number of values. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, your average response time is all of them added together (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) divided by the number of responses (5) which equals 3.8 minutes.\n\u200b\nMaximum\nis the largest value from the time period. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, the maximum value is 6 minutes.\n\u200b\nMedian\nis the middle value in all of your response times. The middle value is what separates the higher half from the lower half of your total response times. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, your median response time is 4 minutes (the middle value).\n\u200b\nMinimum\nis the smallest value from the time period. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, the minimum value is 1 minutes.\nHow do I change the aggregation from Median to Average?\nYou can change the aggregation from Median to Average for a chart in 3 ways:\nWhen adding the chart from the chart library, you can select the aggregation (and whether office hours are included) from the dropdown menu.\nTo change the aggregation for a chart you have already added to a report, you need to enter edit mode and delete the chart then add a new chart with the aggregation you want (Median/Average).\nIf it's a custom report you can edit the chart to change the aggregation used. (This requires access to custom reports on the Advanced or Expert plan).\nWhy can\u2019t I use Maximum and Minimum aggregation in a report template?\nIn order to change the chart aggregation to Maximum/Minimum, you\u2019ll need access to custom reports on the Advanced or Expert plan, as this aggregation is only available to customers by directly editing a chart.\nWhy can\u2019t I set whether Bot Inbox Time is included or Excluded in the filters of my report? Where did it go?\nBot Inbox Time is now selected at the metric level. When you select a chart from the chart template library that would be impacted by time in the Bot Inbox, there will be a separate version of the metric for whether it includes time spent assigned to the bot,  or after the bot has handed over to the team.\nCustom reports\nThe sum aggregation returns as 0, is that expected behavior?\nYes, when you have no conversations the sum aggregation returns as 0.\nWhy does the donut chart always show the \u2018Other\u2019 group?\nThis is to ensure that the donut chart compares relationships accurately by showing all \u2018slices\u2019 of the attribute they are viewing by. You can bump up the number of slices by changing the \"Show top value\" beside the attribute you\u2019re viewing by.\nCan I enable View by \u2018Show Other\u2019 for charts other than the donut chart?\nNo, only donut charts support showing the \"Other\" grouping for the attribute being viewed by at this time.\nHow can I create a stacked line chart?\nYou can do this by creating an area chart and setting the\nstacked\ntoggle to \"On\".\nWhen using the metric \"New conversations\",  and filtering by User tag, I can still see conversations with users that have tags added. Why?\nFor the metric \"new conversations\", we take a snapshot of the first message in the conversation to populate data in the report. If the tag was added to the user profile after the conversation started, the conversation will still be added to the report.\nWhy doesn't the summary row value add up to the sum of all the rows?\nThe summary row is a roll-up of the selected metric, recalculated at an aggregate level. It is not a sum or average of the rows in the table. This approach ensures the most accurate and relevant insights for overall performance.\nFor example, for the \"Closed conversations\" metric it represents the count of unique conversations closed. The summary row displays the total number of unique conversations closed over the specified date range, following the metric's definition. If it was to sum up the values in the rows below it, then it would often have a higher count as a single conversation might be closed by multiple teammates.\nWhy do I see a number discrepancy when changing the View By based on time for reports?\nIn Intercom reports, each conversation will only count once. So for example, if you have a conversation with multiple replies spanning over a number of days during the a week, once you segment the report per week, that conversation will only show once in the results. However, if you segment the report by day, the conversation will show for each day. This is why you might see a higher number when selecting hours or days.\nCan I use Custom Reports to report on User or Lead data attributes?\nYou cannot create a custom report to only show User or Lead information since custom reports are intended to show a breakdown of Conversations or tickets metrics.\nOnce the Conversations or Tickets are included in a report or chart, depending on your workspace plan options you may be able to drill-in deeper and view the associated Users and Leads for those Conversations and tickets from the report.\nTo create a report specifically for User and Lead profile information and attributes you need to use the 'Data export' feature from the Reporting section and create the report outside of Intercom in your own reporting tool.\nWhy are open conversations values in the conversation state dataset lower than the legacy Conversations report?\nThis is due to conversations that have been open for more than 2 years without changing state. In Reporting we only ingest the past 2 years of data, so conversations where the 'Open' state started more than 2 years ago are not included in the dataset.\nWhat could be the reason I'm seeing discrepancies in my custom report?\nAny identifiable changes made to users/leads or conversations could cause data in your custom report to change.\nWhy do some Open/Snoozed conversations have data missing for date ranges prior to 2025?\nData for 2025 has been backfilled into Reporting already, but due to the large quantity of data, it\u2019ll take a while longer to complete the backfill for 2024 and earlier.\nReporting on team performance\nHow can I set up a Display Unit to showcase live statistics for agent performance and overall performance daily?\nIntercom does not have a direct method to set up a Display Unit for live statistics. However, you can use an external screen share and display a reporting page such as the\nReal-Time Dashboard\nor the\nOverview Report\nto showcase agent performance and overall performance daily.\nHow can I see if a teammate has been actively replying to messages?\nTo see if a teammate has been actively replying to messages, you can either:\nUse the\nReal-time Dashboard\nfeature in Intercom. This dashboard includes a metric for 'Active teammates' which provides information about teammates with a given status, including time on status and total active. To access this information, you would click on the\nTeammates\ntab in the\nReal-time Dashboard\nto see more details about the teammates' activity.\nUse\nTeammate status period dataset\nmetrics in custom reports. This will help you identify the period your teammates have been in\nactive status\n. You can also combine with other charts to see how many conversations were replied to on an hour/daily/weekly/monthly basis using\nConversation actions dataset\n.\nAnalyzing report data\nHow can I analyze reporting data in Intercom?\nEach report chart includes a\nchart drill-in\nfeature which allows you to delve into the data and understand the driving factors behind the metrics you see in reports.\nHow can I export and analyze conversation data?\nIf you need to take a closer look at your conversation data, there are several ways you can download and export your conversation content or data:\nDownload individual conversation content\nExport conversation data to a CSV file\nDownload conversation content in bulk via the API\nExport your conversation data as JSON to Amazon S3\nExporting conversation data older\nthan 2 years can't be done through your workspace, it requires use of the API.\nWhat is a conversation action?\nA conversation action refers to specific actions performed within a conversation. These include tasks such as assignments, replies, and closing conversations. For example, using\nChart Drill-In\nfor the \"replies sent\" metric will display the replies sent by teammates to customers within the selected date period. By clicking on the action ID, you can preview the specific message sent.\nHow is company data handled in a CSV export when a user is part of multiple companies?\nWhere there are multiple companies, the values are all exported separated by commas.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nSales report\nHolistic overview report\nResponsiveness reporting\nEffectiveness reporting\nCustom report chart types and options"},

These customers are not counted anywhere else in the report. \u2014 These include those who searched for articles in the \u200bHelp Center \u200bor Messenger but\ndid not\nend up viewing an article or starting a conversation in a session:\nDifference between customers who are \"seeking support\" and \"unserved\" customers:\nSeeking support\nUnserved\nSeeking support includes customers who have searched for articles and also tried to reach out to you by opening a conversation. Seeking support involves some form of engagement, either through searching for help or initiating a conversation.\nUnserved customers are those who may have visited your Help Center or searched for articles in your Messenger but did not view any articles or start a conversation. They did not engage with the content or seek direct assistance from your support team.\nHover over any section of this chart to see a comparison with the previous time period:\nSessions supported by self-serve and human support\nThis chart shows the split between sessions that were resolved by self-serve, and those supported by your team (human support):\nSelf-serve sessions resolved\n\u2014 Sessions where a customer viewed articles, or received support from a bot, and didn\u2019t start a conversation with a human.\nHuman support supported sessions\n\u2014 Sessions where a customer received support from a teammate, either from the beginning or after attempting to self-serve.\nWhat is a session?\nA session is a 24 hour period in which a customer seeks support.\nEach session begins with the first action to seek support, like landing on the Help Center.\nEach session\u2019s current status will be visible in the report. It will either be:\nStopped seeking support.\nResolved with self-serve support.\nServed by human support, either:\nFrom the start.\nAfter attempting to self-serve.\nProactive messages delivered\nThis chart shows you how many proactive support messages you delivered to your customers, and how many of them were opened, clicked on or reacted to.\nThis is also where you can filter for which messages you consider \u201cProactive\u201d. Click\nManage proactive messages\n.\nThere are many ways to filter your messages. Here's an example:\nTag\n\u2014 Outage.\nContent type\n\u2014 Tooltip groups.\nSender\n\u2014 Messages from your Support team.\nYou can also use different filters in combination.\nThe filters you apply here will also affect the first chart. In this report.\nPro tip:\nApplying a tag or updating the sender of a message retroactively will allow you to filter for it in this report, even if it was already sent previously.\nSelf-serve support resolved sessions\nThis chart shows you a split of those conversations resolved entirely by self serve (in pink), and those which were served by a human after viewing articles or engaging with a bot (in yellow):\nBelow the bar, you\u2019ll see three other metrics:\nSelf-serve resolution rate\n\u2014 The number of resolved sessions which were resolved by self-serve support divided by the total number of resolved sessions seeking support. - Users who stopped seeking support are not included in this calculation.\nArticles resolution rate\n\u2014 The number of article views that didn\u2019t result in a conversation being started divided by the total number of article views.\nAutomated resolution rate\n\u2014 The number of conversations closed by Custom Answers divided by the number of \u201cSeeking support sessions\u201d where Custom Answers delivered an answer. This does\nnot\ninclude Fin AI metrics.\nServed by a teammate\nFinally, the report shows you the outcome and details of the conversations that received human support:\nThose that were served by a teammate after self-serve.\nThose served by a teammate from the beginning.\nYou\u2019ll be able to compare:\nTotal volume.\nConversation ratings.\nMedian first response time.\nMedian time to close.\nThese charts show the often-missed impact of self-serve content on your human support conversations. You may find that conversations with a combination of support methods (self-serve and human) have noticeably different ratings, or time to close.\nYou can not only compare the metrics side by side, but also with the previous time period to see if you\u2019re improving, or need some additional support.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nConversations reporting\nKnowledge explained\nSolve frequent queries with self-serve content\nImproving your customer experience\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT) reporting"},

To see how your messages perform over a specific time period, just select the date range you'd like to measure at the top.\nThe date range selected here will filter the report to show messages which have sent in that period, but individual stats for those messages (like click rate) will show the results for all time.\nYou can also filter by message type to slice the engagement stats you'll see below.\nHover over a bar for any specific day in the\nMessages sent by day\nchart and you\u2019ll see which and how many messages were sent that day. This lets you see things like; which messages get sent to the most users and which messages get sent to very few users in comparison.\nWhat if some messages aren\u2019t sending as expected?\nIf one of your emails is sending to fewer customers than expected, try these\ndeliverability tips\nto boost your send rate.\nOr if a Chat or Post messages is sending to fewer customers than you hoped, rethink your audience filters. For example, you should only target customers who have recently used your app - customers who aren\u2019t active in your app won\u2019t receive your message.\nCheck which users are receiving too many messages\nYou can also see which users received the most messages during your selected time period, and how many messages they received. This helps you know if you\u2019re sending too many messages to any particular user.\nSee how engaging your ongoing messages are\nYour message stats allow you to quickly see how engaging your messages are (sorted from highest to lowest engagement). Click on the sent value to see individual stats for each message. For example, you\u2019ll see how many users opened your message, clicked on a link in your message, or unsubscribed.\nStats for these messages (like click rate) will show the rate for\nall time\nnot just the engagement within the selected time period.\nMake your messages more engaging\nWell-targeted chat or post messages should see an open rate of above 30%. To boost your open and click rates you should\nA/B test your messages\nso that you can fine tune them to be as effective as possible.\nYou should see a minimum open rate of above 25% for well-targeted emails. If you\u2019d like to increase your open rate for any message,\nmake your subject line more engaging.\nExport customer engagement data\nAnalyzing your data can help you better understand the performance of your messages. For example, you can:\nJoin your message data with other data sources, such as your Intercom user data, to see how your messaging impacts behavior or outcomes.\nAnalyze the performance of your messages to see which ones are your best performers.\nUnderstand how a campaign has performed, and conduct an in-depth comparison with other campaigns.\nUse third party business intelligence tools to analyze your message performance over time.\nSee how to export your messages data into CSV files\n.\nIf you want to create more engaging messages, check out these\nEmail marketing best practices\n.\nMeasure a single message\u2019s performance\nYou can easily measure how a single message is performing.

For example, If you select \u2018Clicked\u2019, you\u2019ll see the users who clicked a link in your message. You can use the dropdown to see the number of times each link was clicked:\n\"Clicked\" percentage will only be counted if you have hyperlinks inserted in your messages.

This ensures that sensitive information is protected and that report integrity is maintained.\nTo share reports with your teammates, they will also need to have\nreporting permissions on your workspace\n.\nHow to share a report\nClick the\nShare\nbutton at the top of your report to set it as private, share it with select teammates/roles, or make it accessible to all teammates with reporting permissions within your workspace.\nReport access levels\nYou can specify the access level each teammate/role has to your report.\nFull access:\nAllows teammates to edit, delete, and share reports with others, granting complete control over the report\u2019s content and dissemination.\nExplore only:\nPermits teammates to adjust filters, drill into data for deeper analysis, and export data, without the ability to alter the report\u2019s fundamental structure or content.\nView only:\nEnables teammates to view report data, without capabilities to make changes, adjust filters, or export data.\nTeammates with access\nAccess to a report can be given to specific teammates or\ncustom roles\n.\nWhen a\nrole\nis assigned a certain level of access to a report, all teammates with that role will automatically receive that access. Additionally, any new teammate added to that role will automatically gain access.\nWorkspace access\nYou can also choose to change the default access level to a report for your whole workspace:\nWith your workspace selected:\nAnyone in your workspace with\nreporting permissions\nwill be able to see this report and you can adjust what level of access your entire workspace can have.\nWith \"Restricted\" selected:\nThis will only allow the \"Teammates with access\" to see your report. If no teammates are given access, only you will be able to see the report.\nOnce you've finished updating access to your report, click\nConfirm\nto save the changes\n.\nIf a report is shared with teammates, they'll receive an email notification.\nNote:\nIn cases where there is a conflict between workspace permissions and report level access, the more restrictive option will always take precedence. For instance, if a teammate has \"Can create and edit Reports\" permission on your workspace, but is given \"View only\" access to a specific report, they will adhere to the view-only restriction for that report.\nWhen you add a report to a workspace folder, only teammates who have been granted access to that specific report will see it in their Reports navigation.\nThe report creator will become the designated report owner who cannot be removed. If this teammate is removed from a workspace, a new teammate needs to be assigned as owner of their reports during the teammate removal process.\nFAQs\nWhy are there multiple teammates listed in the share section of my report?\nIf you notice teammates appearing in the share section of your existing reports, it\u2019s because they previously had access to these reports through\nworkspace permissions\n. During the recent feature update, existing teammate permissions were migrated to the individual report level. This ensures that all access rights are maintained consistently with prior settings, allowing your team to continue collaborating seamlessly without any disruption.\nHow do I request access to a report?\nRequests to access reports currently can't be made through your workspace. If you need to change your access level to a report, please reach out directly to the report owner. You'll see a list of teammates who have share access on each report.\nI shared a report with my teammate, but they still can't see it. What could be wrong?\nThere are a couple of reasons why your teammate might not be able to see the report you shared:\nAction confirmation: Make sure to click\nConfirm\nin the bottom right corner after making changes to report access. If this step is missed, the share action won\u2019t be saved, and your teammate won't gain access.\nWorkspace permission restrictions: If your teammate lacks the necessary\nworkspace permissions\nto view reports, they won't be able to access the shared report. This issue will be indicated by an error icon next to their name when you attempt to share the report. Ensure that your teammate has the correct workspace permissions enabled for reports.\nCan I share a report with teammates who don't have a seat in our workspace?\nReports can only be shared internally with teammates who have a\nseat\nin the workspace. This means that to access a report, a teammate must have an assigned seat within your workspace (this can be a\nlite seat\n).\nWhy is one of my custom workspace navigation folders completely blank?\nIf a folder appears empty, it may be because you no longer have access to the reports that were previously added to it. Reports remain visible in your folders only as long as you retain access. If your permissions to these reports are revoked, they will no longer appear in your reports list or in any folders they were added to.\nI can't access a report, what should I do?\nIf you're having trouble accessing specific reports:\nVerify that you're looking for the correct report title.\nCheck if you have the necessary permissions to view the report.\nRequest access from a teammate who can view the report by having them:\nClick the 'Share' button at the top of the report\nAdd your name to the list of teammates with access.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nPermissions: how to restrict access for some teammates\nLimit teammates' access to conversations\nSet up custom roles with recommended permissions\nSeats\nKnowledge FAQs"},

These features are not related and work independently.\nWhat are conversation topics?\nA conversation topic is a way for you to categorize every conversation in your workspace.\nIt\u2019s a conversation property, which is automatically applied to matching conversations based on key phrases you define.\nUnlike\nconversation tags\n, and\ncustom conversation data\n, topics can be applied retroactively to your existing conversations.\nLearn more about the different ways to\norganize your conversations\n.\nTo see a visual breakdown of the topics your customers chat about, and new suggestions, go to\nReports > Conversation topics > Topics\n.\n\ud83d\udc46This page shows which topics generate the most conversations, with the higher volume topics represented by larger circles.\nStart with suggested topics\nThe Conversation topics report gives you a head start on topics to track, with topic suggestions presented under\nReports > Conversation topics > Suggestions\n.\nThis report typically needs about 5,000 total conversations to generate meaningful topic suggestions. The rule of thumb is the more conversations, the better the suggestions will be.\nIf your total conversation volume is lower than about 5000, you won\u2019t have topic suggestions, however, when your total conversation volume exceeds this number, topic suggestions will start to show.\nEligible conversations for topic suggestion includes those which are:\nInbound\nFrom the Messenger\nIn English\nNot involving Workflows\nHave no Custom Answers content suggestions\nCome from relatively short queries (< ~60 words)\nNew suggestions are generated nightly.\nSuggested topics are only available in English currently.\nYou can also see these alongside existing topics with the \"Show topics\" toggle:\nTopic suggestions are potential groupings of conversations that share similar keyphrases. In this example, you can see the topic \"Tasks\", based on the keyphrases:\nTask\nAdd task\nDuplicate task\nFor a deeper understanding of how your customers feel about these topics, enable \u201cShow customer satisfaction\u201d and see the average customer satisfaction for each topic:\nAny areas in orange or red are towards the lower end of your CSAT scores.\nConversation volume is just one piece of the puzzle for your team.\nNext, switch to sorting by responsiveness instead of volume:\nNow you\u2019ll see your conversation topics on a scatter plot, with median time to close and median first response time on the Y and X axes.\nThis tells you what your customers are asking about, and what that means for your team.\nFor some quick efficiency gains, the conversation topics in this area are those with the quickest response time, and the quickest time to close.\nTry covering them in Help Center articles or macros.\nBelow the chart, each suggestion also shows how the topic is trending against the previous period in a number of areas:\nTotal volume of conversations that match this topic.\nMedian first response time.\nMedian time to close.\nCustomer satisfaction rating.\nClick the header of any of these columns to sort the list.\nThis lets you zoom in on areas where your team\u2019s performance could be improved, with things like:\nHelp Center articles\nto lower conversation volume.\nMacros\nto speed up response times.\nMore training or\ninternal tools\nto ensure your\ncustomers are satisfied\n.\nTo save a suggestion as a topic, select it from the list, and click\n+\nAdd to your topics\nor select multiple and click\nMerge suggestions\n.\nYou\u2019ll then see them in the list of saved topics, where you can also see the same metrics. \ud83d\udc4c\nTo show the stats for a certain period of time just use the filter at the top of the page. You can also choose to exclude\ntime spent in the Bot inbox\nfrom the data shown.\nCreating conversation topics from scratch\nTo start tracking a topic that isn\u2019t in your Conversation topics report, go to\nReports > Conversation topics > Topics\nand click\nNew topic.\nThen, enter all the relevant words and phrases your customers use to talk about this topic and separate them by pressing enter.\nHow do keywords and phrases work?\nConversations match keywords and phrases with \u201cOr\u201d logic, so they only need to match one, not all to be included in the topic.\nIndividual words in a phrase will match if they are up to 3 words apart. For example: the phrase \u201ctracking time\u201d would match a conversation that contains the phrase \u201cTracking my work time\u201d (word order is relevant).\nKeywords are matched based on their root word, so \u201cPlanning\u201d would match \u201cPlan\u201d, \u201cPlanner\u201d, \u201cPlans\u201d etc.\nTo match for an exact phrase, made up of multiple words, include it in quotes like \"to do list\".\nOptionally, you can also add keywords to\nexclude\ncertain conversations:\nFor further refinement, you can choose to include conversations where\nteammates\nused the keywords, or just conversations where\nusers\nused them.\nPro tip:\nThis is a handy way to measure how often a macro is used. Just pick a keyphrase from a macro and filter for teammates only. \ud83d\udc4c\nFinally, you can add any other conditions based on your\nconversation data\n, like this example which filters for a certain \u201cProduct Area\u201d:\nYou\u2019ll immediately see conversations appearing so you can take a quick glance and ensure the right conversations matching the keywords and rules you\u2019ve defined.\nFinally, give your topic a title and save it.\nThis conversation topic will immediately be applied to all matching conversations, you\u2019ll\nsee it in the Inbox\n, and can\nutilize it as a property in your reports\n.\nDive deep on a topic\nOnce you've set up your Conversation topics report, go to\nReports > Conversation topics > Topics\nand click on a topic.\nHere you\u2019ll see a list of all the most recent conversations that match the topic, and you can open them up to see more.\nIf you find conversations that don\u2019t match your topic as well as you\u2019d hoped, you can always edit the topic to add or remove keywords.\nThis will update any conversations that were historically included in that topic to ensure they still match.\nConversation topics in the inbox\nAs these conversation topics are automatically applied to conversations (when they match the keywords and rules you\u2019ve defined) you\u2019ll see this reflected in the Inbox under \"Conversation attributes\".\nIf you\u2019d like to remove a specific topic from a conversation, just click the\nX\non a topic. Or, click the\n+ icon\nto add a topic manually.\nNote:\nThis will not impact the keywords or definition for that topic.\nOnly saved topics are applied automatically, not suggestions.\nAfter removed, a topic can only be re-added to a conversation manually.\nThis does not work for\nAI-generated topics and subtopics\n.\nConversation topics in reports\nOnce you have defined conversation topics, you can use them to filter your reports.\nOr use topics to filter and segment your very own custom reports.\nIt's not possible to track when a topic was added/removed, or by which teammate.\nConversation topics are also available in the\nconversations export\n, and via the API.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nConversations reporting\nHolistic overview report\nConversation tags reporting\nHow and when to use conversation topics, attributes, and tags\nUse the Topics Explorer to see what\u2019s driving volume"},
{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8870221-custom-report-chart-types-and-options", "title": "Custom report chart types and options", "content": "Chart types\nThere are nine\nchart types\nto provide you with flexible ways of visualizing your data, including: KPI, column, bar, donut, line, combo, area, heatmap, and table.\nKPI chart\nKPIs are the perfect way to get a quick summary without the need for a detailed breakdown of your data. This chart will show an\naverage calculation\nof the data for the period select.\nColumn chart\nWith a simple column chart, you can break down the data by\nconversation data attributes\n,\nuser data\nor other\nmetrics & properties\nin Intercom.\nYou can also define exactly how many of the top groups to show.\nWith a column chart, segmenting the data lets you visualize it in two dimensions. In this example you can see the columns are grouped by \"Week\", and segmented by the \u201cTeam currently assigned\u201d:\nBar chart\nBar charts simplify the comparison of data across different categories, making it easy to evaluate relative performance and trends.\nDonut chart\nA donut chart is a visual representation that shows parts of a whole by dividing a  into segments. This chart is excellent for comparing the relationship among multiple attributes for a single metric, offering a clear and concise visual representation.\nA donut chart cannot be segmented down further and can only show one view by layer. Donut charts also do not support the following chart options:\nTargets\nTime comparisons\nStacked chart\nLine chart\nLine charts offer the same options to view and segment your data, but are better suited to showing trends over time.\nWhen using the\nline\nchart type, if selecting 'view by: time' with a single point, the line series on the charts will appear as a single dot. You will need to select a smaller time granularity to see change over more than one breakdown.\nCombo chart\nA combo chart is great for comparing two metrics with different Y axis.\nThe first metric selected will use a Column chart and use the left Y axis, and the second metric selected will use a Line chart and the right Y axis.\nLearn more about using\nmulti-metric charts\n.\nArea chart\nAn area chart enables you to observe the cumulative effect of data points over time. By filling in the area between lines with colors and shading, it offers an enhanced perspective on the volume or total of the data points, making it easier to comprehend the overall impact.\nHeatmap\nHeatmaps visualize the distribution of data across a spectrum, allowing you to quickly identify trends and anomalies in large datasets.\nHeatmaps are limited to view data per hour across each day of the week. This type of report cannot be segmented down further.\nTable chart\nA table gives you a sortable list of values broken down by the dimensions you choose, for example this shows \"New conversations\" by week, segmented by \"Teammate currently assigned\".\nChart options\nAggregation methods\n:\nWe have two aggregation methods for time-based and ratio metrics: SUM and Percentile. These methods provide more precise and flexible options for analyzing your data, offering deeper insights and a more nuanced understanding of your metrics.\nTime period comparison\n:\nEnhance your analysis with the ability to visually compare a metric across two different time periods. This feature provides a straightforward way to identify trends, changes, or improvements, facilitating a better understanding of temporal shifts in your data.\nTargets\n:\nYou can set and compare your metrics against manually inserted targets in selected chart types. This feature adds an extra layer of analysis, allowing for goal-oriented evaluation and tracking.\nRelative stacked charts\n:\nThe relative chart option feature in stacked area or column charts enables you to visualize each attribute's proportional contribution to the overall total, offering a clear comparison of individual elements within the context of one data point.\nTable summary row\n:\nThere is an option to add a 'summary' row to tables, which displays the aggregated value for each column, providing a concise overview of key data at a glance.\nThe\nOptions\ntab contains more settings which allow you to customize certain elements of a chart.\nThe 4 available options are:\nStacked\nShow relative values\nShow data labels\nShow target\nNot all options appear on every chart type. Use the table below to see which options are available in each chart type:\nChart type\nStacked\nShow relative values\nShow data labels\nShow target\nKPI\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u2705\nColumn\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nLine\n\u26d4\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nDonut\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u2705\n\u26d4\nCombo\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u2705\n\u26d4\nArea\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\nTable\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u2705\nHeatmap\n\u26d4\n\u26d4\n\u2705\n\u26d4\nBar\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u2705\n\u26d4\nAggregation methods\nThere are multiple aggregation methods available on time based metrics and ratio metrics.\nAverage:\nThe total of all values divided by the number of values. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, your average response time is all of them added together (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) divided by the number of responses (5) which equals 3.8 minutes.\nMedian:\nThe middle value in all of your response times. The middle value is what separates the higher half from the lower half of your total response times. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, your median response time is 4 minutes (the middle value).\nPercentile:\nExisting options like the minimum (1st percentile) show the lowest value, the maximum (100th percentile) the highest, and the median (50th percentile) the middle value of a dataset; now, with the new feature, customers can choose any percentile between 1 and 100. Custom percentiles offer a more nuanced view of your data. While the median gives a good sense of the middle, and the min/max provide the range, custom percentiles allow you to analyze specific segments of your data distribution, tailoring your insights to your specific needs or goals.\nMinimum:\nThe smallest value from the time period. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, the minimum value is 1 minutes.\nMaximum:\nThe largest value from the time period. For example, if you have five response times of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes, the maximum value is 6 minutes.\nSum:\nThe main function of the sum aggregation is to calculate the total of numerical values. This operation is executed on one or more attribute columns within a dataset, that are used in defining metrics. It's only applicable to numeric data types, such as integers and decimals. During this process, the sum operation iteratively adds the value from each row of the specified column(s), accumulating a running total.\nTime period comparisons\n\"Compare to previous period\" enables you to visually compare a metric across two different time periods.\nFor example, if you're analyzing the First response rime (FRT) over the last 12 weeks and select the option \"Compare to previous period\", the chart will display both the data for the most recent 12 weeks and the data for the 12 weeks preceding them.\nTime period comparison only works when you view by time. It will not work when you view by or segment by any other attributes.\nTargets\nYou can set and compare your metrics against manually inserted targets in selected chart types. This feature adds an extra layer of analysis, allowing for goal-oriented evaluation and tracking.\nYou can compare your metrics to a manually inserted target in the below chart types:\nKPI\nColumn\nBar\nDonut\nLine\nArea\nHeatmap\nTable\nThe\ntable\nchart type employs a conditional color scheme depending on the chosen metric. For example, with a metric like \"closed conversations\" and a target of 500, values below 500 are displayed in red, while those above 500 appear in green. Conversely, for metrics where lower values are preferable, such as first response time, values falling below the target are shown in green, and those exceeding the target are highlighted in red.\nRelative stacked charts\nThe relative chart option feature in stacked area or column charts enables users to visualize each attribute's proportional contribution to the overall total, offering a clear comparison of individual elements within the context of one data point.\nNote:\nThe relative chart option will only be enabled when the \u201cStacked\u201d option is enabled.\nRelative stacked charts are only available on column and area charts.\nTable summary row\nCustomers can add an additional \u201csummary\u201d row to a table via a chart option. The summary row shows the aggregated value for each column of a table.\nThe summary row is not the same as a total row. It is possible that the values in each row do not add up to the value displayed in the summary for certain metrics.\nConsistent data series colors\nThe data series in charts and reports maintain a consistent color, ensuring uniformity and ease of recognition across different visualizations.

For example, this chart is filtered by conversations which have:\nTopic = \u201cpricing\u201d\nOR\nTag = \u201cpricing\u201d\nIntercom takes a snapshot of the customer when the conversation starts which means that any changes to user and company attributes after the conversation is created are not reflected in the reports.\nA couple exceptions where the information is loaded in real-time: User name, User pseudonym, and User email attributes.\nAdditionally, some metrics (those that are calculated at the time vs. a static value, like Customer satisfaction) will display an error when the selected break down has more than 10,000 unique values for the range/filters.\nCompany attributes filters in custom reports\nYou can choose a company attribute as a filter in a custom report at the report level, or at an individual chart level. Note that if you do both, the report level filter takes precedence.\nThe\ncompany attribute filter\nallows you to only\nfilter\nby company attributes but does not allow you to group by them.

Here\u2019s how these filters interact:\nReport filters apply to charts within the report\nWhen you add a filter to a report, it automatically applies to\nall\ncharts within that report.\nFor example, if you apply a date filter to the report, this will override the date filter of any chart within the report.\nIf a chart is set to display data for \"today,\" but the report\u2019s date filter is set to \"yesterday,\" the chart will display data for \"yesterday\" when viewed within the report.\nChart builder filters are not overridden\nReport filters do not affect what you see when building or editing a chart in the chart builder. They only take effect when viewing the chart within the report.\nFilters combine in an \"AND\" relationship\nIf both the report and a chart have filters, they combine as if they\u2019re joined by an \u201cAND\u201d condition.\nFor example, the chart in this report filters for data from Germany, and we\u2019ve applied a filter at the report level for \u2018Channel is Email\u2019. This means the chart is now showing data from conversations started in Berlin via Email:\nNote:\nThe \u2018Channel\u2019 filter will only contain those channels where you have installed Intercom.\nCustom events\nare currently not supported for filtering custom reports.\nAdd a banner component\nDuring the report creation process, you can add a banner component.\nYou can control:\nFont size\nFont weight\nFont position\nAdding a link\nChanging the color\nResizing the component\nSave and share your custom report\nWhen you've finished customizing your report, click\nSave.\nThis will open the\nshare report options\n. You can also click the\nShare\nbutton any time from the top of your report to change these settings.\nViewing custom reports\nAny custom reports that you create personally, are listed in\nReports > Your reports\n.\nAny custom reports created by other teammates and shared with you, are accessible from\nReports > All reports > Shared with you\n.\nLearn more about\nreport sharing and accessibility\n.\nWhen viewing a report you can easily add more filters which will apply\nin addition to\nexisting filters that are set within the charts.\nFor filters to persist after closing the report (and be visible to other teammates with access to the report), you'll need to edit the report, apply the filters, and then save the report.\nData exploration\nEvery chart has a\ndrill-in feature\n, enabling you to explore the underlying data behind your metrics. This allows you to gain a clearer understanding of the factors driving your results and make data-informed decisions faster.\nManaging custom reports\nYou can edit, duplicate, or delete any custom report that you have\nfull access\nto. Go to\nReports\nand open the report you want to manage, then use the options in the top right to:\nShare\nEdit\nDuplicate\nAdd to favorites\nDelete\nSeeing unexpected results?\nIf you\u2019re unsure of the data in your reports, check out this\narticle\nfor a close look at some of the details.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nConversations reporting\nCalls reporting\nTeammate performance reporting\nCustom report chart types and options"},

All charts can be resized and moved around to where you want them.\nWhen you add a new chart to your report, it will automatically generate a title based on the metric and aggregation used, for example \"Average First response time\", and if you add a chart from the Chart library it will already have a title. If you edit the chart and change the metric or aggregation\nthis will not update the chart's title\n. You will need to update the title manually to reflect the change.\nLearn more about customizing reports\n.\nResponsiveness report use cases\nRespond quickly to every message\nReplying to your customers quickly is essential to keeping them engaged.\nResponse time\nis how quickly your team reply to your customers at any point in a conversation (i.e., not just the first response). You can view this in the\nMedian response time - by time\nchart.\nPrioritize new conversations\nHow quickly you first respond is crucial to easing your customer\u2019s frustrations.\nFirst response time\ntells you how long your customers wait for your first response, so you\u2019ll know when to focus more resources on new conversations. You'll also get a breakdown of the percent of conversations that fall into 7 distinct groupings.\nThe\nFirst response time: including time assigned to bot - by time\nchart shows you the time from when the conversation started to the first teammate's reply and how this is changing over time.\nYou can edit the report and add the appropriate chart to include or exclude bot inbox time.\nNote:\nFirst response time includes response times for replies to\none-off messages, ongoing messages\nand inbound conversations.\nThe charts show the 'First response time' grouped by conversation creation date. So even though we only count the time within workspace office hours (when you have this enabled in your\nOffice Hours settings\n), this will be displayed on the chart according to the time the conversation was created. Individual team office hours aren\u2019t taken into account.\nIf an inbound conversation is closed without any initial response from a teammate (e.g. closing a duplicate conversation), then this will not be considered in any of the median response time metrics. There needs to be a pair of customer message + teammate message to contribute towards to the median response time.\nBot responses\nare not\nincluded in the 'First response time' metrics.\nResolve issues faster\nYour team\u2019s time to resolution will directly impact how customers rate your teammates\u2019 conversations.\nThe\nTime to close\nchart tells you how quickly your teammates close conversations and resolve your customers\u2019 issues.\nSnoozing a conversation counts towards the 'time to close'.\nPro tip:\nEncourage your customers to\nopen new conversations after issues are resolved\n, to get the most accurate view of your time to close.\nBe more responsive\nIt\u2019s easy to see at a glance when your teams are least responsive. You can view this in the\nMedian hourly distribution of response times\nchart\n-\nthis will highlight any significant gaps in your support roster.\nThis chart is tracking\nboth first response time and subsequent response time\nPro tip:\nIf you spot a drop in responsiveness during lunch hours, you might split your team\u2019s lunch period into two groups that have lunch at separate times so you can ensure full cover during working hours.\nFiltering the responsiveness report\nThe charts can show response time by day, week, or month, depending on the time period you've selected at the top of the report.\nYou can also add filters to all charts in the report, for example to view responsiveness per teammate or team.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHolistic overview report\nEffectiveness reporting\nTeammate performance reporting\nTeam inbox performance reporting\nReporting FAQs"},

This fosters better team morale and targeted skill development, directly improving customer interactions.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of your AI agents (Fin)\nAnalyze the\nFin AI Agent CSAT score\nto see how it compares to teammate CSAT. If the score is significantly lower than human teammates, you'll need to work on refining Fin to better address customer needs. This could involve\naddressing content gaps\nto help Fin resolve more queries, or expanding its capabilities such as\nsetting up data & actions\nfor personalized answers.\nMonitoring trends and identifying the impact of operational changes\nAnalyze the\nCSAT score over time\nfor spikes or dips to correlate changes (e.g., new policies, product launches, or staffing adjustments) with customer sentiment. Use this to identify successful initiatives or areas needing attention.\nComprehensive sentiment analysis\nAggregate remarks provide a high-level view of customer sentiment, helping to spot recurring themes or sentiments that influence satisfaction.\nAmazing remarks\nAnalyze these remarks to identify what customers love about your support. Share these interactions as examples in training sessions and use them in marketing materials to showcase customer satisfaction.\nGreat remarks\nReview these to see what contributes to positive but not \"amazing\" feedback. Fine-tune these areas to turn \"great\" into \"amazing.\"\nOk remarks\nAnalyze these to identify areas where customers' expectations were met but not exceeded. Focus on these areas to find small tweaks that could lead to higher satisfaction scores.\nBad remarks\nDeep dive into these interactions to identify clear failures in processes, product, or communication. Address the issues promptly to prevent future dissatisfaction.\nTerrible remarks\nInvestigate these remarks immediately to determine whether they point to systemic issues or isolated incidents. Use these cases as an impetus for larger changes if necessary.\nMeasuring satisfaction at the conversation level\nUse the\nConversation ratings\nchart to understand which conversations are driving satisfaction or dissatisfaction. You can filter the table by \"Conversation rating\" to see conversations with negative CSAT and focus on these first.\nMeasuring the effectiveness of survey distribution\nLook at the\nCSAT request rate\nchart to ensure surveys are being sent at the right time and to the right audiences. Adjust request strategies if rates are low, aligning with business goals of data collection.\nEnsuring representative feedback\nMonitor the\nCSAT response rate\nchart and if response rates are low, assess the timing, format, or incentives of your surveys. High response rates ensure you capture a broader and more accurate view of customer sentiment.\nAnalyze when customers are most likely to respond to surveys using the\nCSAT survey request & response rates - by time\nchart. Adjust survey requests to align with peak response times, improving data collection efficiency.\nTargeted process improvement\nUse the\nTopics driving dissatisfaction\nchart to identify recurring themes in dissatisfaction (e.g., product bugs) and prioritize these for resolution. This directly addresses root causes of customer frustration.\nDriving accountability and training\nCompare\nTeammate CSAT performance\nto identify top performers for recognition and lower performers for targeted training.

You can track your new inbound conversations, busiest periods and biggest customer issues, and optimize your support.\nCreate a conversations report\nGo to\nReports\nand create a new report, then select the\nConversations\ntemplate to get started quickly.\nYou can also use a range of\nconversation metrics and attributes\nto create your own\ncustom report\non the Advanced or Expert plan.\nUse the conversations report template to see\nNew conversations\nConversations replied to\nReplies sent\nClosed conversations\nNew conversations - by time\nNew conversations - by channel\nReplies sent - by time\nComparison of New Conversations and Replies\nHourly Distribution of New Conversations\nUnderstand chart data\nHover over the information icon at the top of a chart to see reporting period, report level filters, metrics, and metric level filters applied to each chart.\nLearn more about conversation metrics in the\nConversations dataset\n.\nCustomize the conversations report template\nThe conversations report template is fully customizable, enabling you to add more charts from the chart library, or remove charts you don't need in this report. All charts can be resized and moved around to where you want them.\nLearn more about customizing reports\n.\nConversations report use cases\nManage your team\u2019s workload with the 'New conversations - by time' chart\nYou can track how many new conversations you\u2019re handling over time with the\nNew conversations - by time\nchart, so you can identify long-term growth trends. You\u2019ll be able to see if you need to streamline your support process, hire more staff or tackle recurring spikes in volume.\nThe previous date range is also shown alongside the current one, so you can compare two periods.\nIt\u2019s important that you can easily compare the same days with each other across weeks. To compare two weeks like-for-like, you need to set the time range to be divisible by 7 days (i.e. 14 days, 84 days, 210 days etc). For example, if you select a period that\u2019s not divisible by 7, such as 12 days, the days of each week won\u2019t line up with each other correctly.\nUnderstand the rate that conversations are being replied to\nThe\nComparison of New Conversations and Replies\nchart shows the number of conversations started in the chosen period (in blue) alongside the number of conversations where teammates have replied (in yellow).\nThe \u2018conversations replied to\u2019, may include conversations started before your filtered date range.\nThe ideal result in this chart is an even number of conversations started and replied to.\nIf you see fewer conversations replied to than conversations started, your team may be experiencing a backlog of conversations.\nMore conversations replied to than started, suggests your team are working through a backlog of older conversations, or responding to conversations which have reopened.\nSee which channels your conversations are coming from\nThe\nNew conversations - by channel\nchart will show you how your new conversations are spread across the channels you support.  Channels are the different ways that customers can start a conversation with you.\nBreak down how many replies your team send\nFor another view of your team\u2019s workload, the\nReplies sent\nchart shows how many replies they\u2019ve sent within your selected date range.\n'Replies sent' in the\nlegacy conversations report\ncounts teammate replies to conversations without a user response. However, \u2018Replies sent\u2019 in the new conversations report template and custom reports only count teammate replies in conversations with a user response.\nTackle the busy periods\nIt's easy to check which days and times get the most new conversations in the\nHourly Distribution of New Conversations\nchart, so you can make sure you have enough teammates available to manage the busy periods.\nUseful conversations report filters\nYou can gauge your team\u2019s workload for any period up to a year, using the date range filter.\nYou can also filter your conversations report by:\nTag\n\u2014 Review a subset of conversations with certain tags.\nContinent\n\u2014 Select a single continent, or more than one.\nCountry\n\u2014 Choose a single country, or more than one.\nChannel\n\u2014 Filter based on where conversations started.

{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8827723-contacts-faqs", "title": "Contacts FAQs", "content": "Managing contact data\nHow does Intercom collect and allow access to user and visitor data?\nIntercom collects data differently for logged-in users and logged-out visitors or leads, depending on how it\u2019s installed on your site.\nFor\nlogged-in users\n, you identify them by passing specific data into the Intercom JavaScript snippet\u2014typically a user_id and/or email address. This lets Intercom associate activity and attributes with a known user.\nFor\nvisitors\nwho haven\u2019t logged in or shared identifying info (like an email), Intercom still collects certain data by default. This includes:\nFirst and last seen dates\nLast contact date (from you or a teammate)\nNumber of web sessions\nBrowser language and version\nPreferred language setting\nURLs visited\nCity and country\nOperating system\nThis visitor data is tied to an intercom-id or intercom-session cookie until the visitor is identified or converted into a user.\nYou can access both user and visitor data via your Intercom workspace (on lead/user profile pages under Contacts) or programmatically through the Intercom API, which allows you to fetch, update, convert, or delete this data.\nHow does my lead's qualification data get updated?\nThere are three ways to update your lead\u2019s qualification data in Intercom. You can:\nManually update lead qualification data in your leads\u2019 profiles.\nTrack lead qualification data captured on your website or product, and send it to Intercom via a ping (just like you would with your\ncustom attributes\n).\nSet up a Workflow to automatically\ncollect and update your leads\u2019 data\n.\nWhat happens when multiple data points are competing?\nManually edited data is the primary data source\nManually edited data is never overwritten by ping or bot-collected data.\nTo clear qualification data you\u2019ve manually added, just hover over this qualification data and select the re-sync option. This will allow you to start automatically collecting data again.\nIf you do a CSV import or update a user via the REST API this will over-ride manually edited data.\nPing data is the secondary data source\nPing data\nis never overwritten by Operator-collected data.\nOperator data is considered tertiary\nOperator-collected data is only added to a lead\u2019s profile when the data attribute is empty.\nWhat is qualification data?\nQualification data\nis a special set of\nattributes\nyou can update in your lead and user qualification profiles as you qualify them.\nYou can choose which data appears in your lead and user qualification profiles. Just visit your\nqualification settings\nin Intercom and select \u2018Add data\u2019:\nThere are 2 ways you can add data from here. You can:\nChoose from the custom attributes you\u2019ve already added to Intercom.\nClick \u2018create new data\u2019 to\ncreate new custom qualification data\n.\nYou can also \u2018Add\u2019 or \u2018Remove\u2019 any data you like, and this will change the qualification data that appears in your lead and user profiles.\nHow do I qualify my customers with qualification data?\nThere are two ways you can qualify your customers in Intercom. You can:\nManually qualify your leads and users in the Help Desk\nas you chat to them.\nAnd/or\nset up our bot, Operator, to automatically ask leads questions\non your behalf, based on whatever data is most important for your business.\nIt\u2019s also possible to update lead qualification data via a ping (just like you would with your\ncustom attributes\n). And, you can update it via a CSV import or through the REST API.\nCheck out our best practices on how to\nchoose the right qualification data for your business\n.\nHow do I edit a user or lead's email address?\nUpdating a user/lead's email address depends on how you've chosen to identify contacts in Intercom:\nIf you use\nUser IDs\nas unique identifiers, you can change the email address by going to your Contacts and opening the user/lead's profile then editing the email address under the \"Qualification\" section.\nIf you do not use User IDs\n, the email address acts as the unique identifier and can't be changed. In this case, we recommend\narchiving the existing user/lead\nand creating a new one with the correct email address.\nHow can I permanently delete users and leads?\nVia the UI\nIf you\u2019d like to permanently remove all data associated with a user/lead so it can\u2019t be retrieved you can do this through the \u2018\nDelete data\n\u2019 tab in your settings.\nEnter the user ID or email of the user you want to delete, then select the user. Once you click \u2018Permanently delete\u2019, this will remove all of their associated data.\nVia REST API\nTo delete the user via REST API you'll need:\nREST API bearer token and\nIntercom user ID of the user that you want to permanently delete\nIf you are deleting a single user, you can use our\nDelete contact endpoint developer documentation\n. On this page, you'll need to input your Bearer token and the Intercom User ID in their respective fields:\n\u200b\nImportant:\nOnce a user/lead has been deleted, you cannot view them in the Intercom UI.\nIf you delete a user/lead by mistake, contact us within 7 days and we can retrieve the information. After 7 days this data will be permanently destroyed.\nCSAT ratings and comments from a user will not be deleted.\nDeleting leads or users will remove all of their conversations from Intercom, but historic conversations from archived or deleted contacts will still be included in\nyour reporting\n.\nIf you have\nexported user data\n, you may also need to delete those files in order to comply with GDPR legislation.\nIs there a way to adjust the web Messenger to check and update an existing profile instead of creating a new one?\nYou can adjust how user profiles are created or updated in Intercom by ensuring you\u2019re passing consistent user identifiers. Intercom uses the user_id as the primary identifier when it\u2019s provided, and if it\u2019s missing, it falls back to using the email address.\nIf a new user_id is passed\u2014even with the same email\u2014a new user will be created. To update an existing user instead of creating a new one, make sure to:\nAlways pass the same user_id for returning users.\nIf you\u2019re using the web messenger with custom code, ensure your app logic correctly assigns the user_id and/or email when initializing Intercom (via the JavaScript API or REST API).\nAvoid using different user_ids for the same email, as this leads to duplicate profiles that cannot be merged.\nIf you\u2019re seeing duplicates, you can:\nClean them up manually\nor via the API.\nAudit your API implementation to ensure consistent identifiers are being sent.\nFor further help, please provide us with an example user or snippet of your current implementation.\nHow do you remove a tag from a user?\nThis is something you can do from a user's profile page in Contacts. On the left side of the user's profile page, you'll see the user data menu with \"User tags.\" You can remove the tag by hovering over the tag and clicking the [X] icon.\nCan I create new users with the same user ID and/or email as a deleted user?\nThis is only possible after the 7 day grace period, because the deleted users still exist in the database with those user IDs/emails. If you urgently need to create new users with the same user ID/email as those that were deleted in the 7 day grace period you can:\nUse our REST API to update the user ID (\nexternnal_id\n)/email e.g.\nUser ID = 123\n->\nUser ID = 123_delete\nThen delete the user(s) again.\nNow create the user(s) with the desired user ID/email e.g.\nUser ID = 123.\nCan I link directly to a user's profile?\nYou can create links for user profiles simply by adding the User ID or email address of your user to the URLs below.\nUser ID:\nhttps://app.intercom.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/users/show?user_id=THE_USER_ID\nThe\nUser ID\nhere is the ID that you have set for the user. If you do not use User ID's, you will need a slightly different URL where you can use the Intercom ID which all Users have:\nhttps://app.intercom.com/apps/YOUR_APP-ID/users/show?id=INTERCOM_ID\nThe Intercom ID for a User can be found in the URL when viewing their profile page in Intercom:\n\u200b\nEmail Address:\nhttps://app.intercom.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/users/show?email=THE_USER_EMAIL\nThis URL will only work for unique email addresses - these are email addresses that exist once in your user list.\nRegional Workspaces\nIf you have a regional workspace in the EU or AU regions, make sure to adapt your URLs for this.\n\u200b\nYou can identify which data region you\u2019re hosted in by looking at your workspace URL:\napp.intercom.com\nfor US customers\napp.eu.intercom.com\nfor EU customers\napp.au.intercom.com\nfor Australian customers\nWhy am I missing users that are showing up on my own system?\nYour users might have installed a JavaScript blocking browser plugin/extension that uses the\nEasyList\nor similar list. This is especially likely if the number of users missing from Intercom is only a small and infrequently occurring percentage.\nWhy would an adblocking extension or plugin block Intercom?\nWhile Intercom isn't an ad-provider, adblocking plugins (e.g. uBlock, Ghostery, Adblock, NoScript, and Firefox Privacy Browsing mode) offer options to block JavaScript that includes tracking functionality.\nSince Intercom communicates conversation detail as well as offering the ability to submit attributes and events on your Users' behavior, we are included in some of these secondary lists. Though there are many lists, the majority of Intercom blockages are caused by our inclusion in the\nEasyList\nlist.\nWhat's EasyList?\nEasyList\nis an optional supplementary subscription that completely removes all forms of tracking from the internet, including web bugs, tracking scripts and information collectors, thereby protecting your personal\ndata.\nAt Intercom, we respect customer privacy where requested so we don't argue against our inclusion here, but you can certainly request that your users disable plugins like this, or add an exception for your site for better performance.\nHow can I keep data in Intercom synced with my system for these users?\nYou can ask your users to disable JavaScript blockers. Googling for\nJavaScript blocker detection\nor\nAdblock detection\nwill provide many resources on doing this.\nYou can sync your backend with the\nIntercom API\n. There are several API wrappers that might suit your application well including:\nRuby\n,\nNode\n,\nPHP\n,\nJava\n,\nGo\nIf you believe you're missing user detail in Intercom for other reasons, feel free to get in touch to look into potential integration issues.\nCan I add a profile picture or avatar image to a lead or user?\nYou can set a contact's avatar image in Intercom using the REST API by following these steps:\u200b\n1. Retrieve the contact's Intercom ID by making a call to the\nSearch for Contacts\nendpoint\n2. Use the Intercom ID to make a call to the\nUpdate Contact\nendpoint, and populate the\navatar object\nwith the URL of the contact's image you would like to use.\nYou can also\npopulate the avatar object in your Messenger installation\n.\nCan I add custom attributes for teammates in my workspace?\nNo. While there are attributes such as 'location' or 'name' in a teammate's profile, you cannot create a new custom attribute for them\nlike you can for your end-users\n.\nUnderstanding contact data\nIs Intercom compliant with HIPAA?\nWhat is HIPAA?\nThe\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nis a set of industry-wide standards to safeguard protected health information (PHI) and electronic protected health information (ePHI).\nCustomers must be able to trust that their health data is being handled securely and their digital privacy respected. HIPAA is one of the standards they rely on for guidance and consistency.\nIs Intercom compliant?\nIntercom has successfully completed a HIPAA attestation examination, which means that we now help our customers fulfill their ePHI obligations as we store and process data in a manner consistent with HIPAA standards.\nIf your business is required to be HIPAA compliant, we can enter into a business associate agreement with your organization.\nWe have a HIPAA attestation report which covers both the HIPAA Security Rule and HITECH Breach Notification Rule that we can share with you. It's confidential, so if you\u2019re not yet an Intercom user, you\u2019ll be required to sign an NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) before receiving it.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nTo access our HIPAA attestation report, current Intercom admins can log in to their Intercom workspace to download and view the report, along with other security and compliance documents. These can be found under\nSecurity settings\n.\nThis report is also available upon request and under NDA for those who don\u2019t currently have access to an Intercom workspace. Get in touch through the Messenger or by emailing\nsecurity@intercom.com\n.\nTo enter into a BAA (business associate agreement) with Intercom, you can reach out to our support team in the Messenger, or email us at\nteam@intercom.io\n.\nHow is a web session defined?\nWe increment a user's session count when one of the below happens:\n1. The user has not sent Intercom a ping for more than 30 minutes and then returns.\n2. The user has been active (sending Intercom a ping every 30 minutes or less) for more than 24 hours.\n3. The user's role changes (e.g. visitor becomes a lead, or lead become a user).\n4. It is a first ping for the user.\nVisits (for visitors and leads) are incremented in the same way as web sessions.\nHow is a mobile session defined?\nIf you are using our\niOS SDK\n, we increment the iOS session count the first time a user is registered and subsequently on every\nUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification\nthat is triggered by a user opening your app, once they happen twenty seconds apart. Application opens within twenty seconds are not counted.\nOur Android SDK is available\nhere\nwhich has similar rules.\nMobile web sessions (i.e., Safari and Chrome on mobile) are captured as web sessions, not mobile sessions.\nHow are company sessions defined?\nWe increment a company's sessions count whenever a user begins a new session in the context of that company. For example, if a user logs in after 1 day with only user data, this will update the user session.\n\u200b\nThen within 30 minutes they ping again with user and company data. This will not increment the user sessions, so it will not increment company sessions either.\nSo, if while part of a company a particular user has 300 sessions and then that user leaves that company, those 300 sessions will still make up part of the total company sessions, even after they leave.\nImportant:\nIf a user is associated with multiple companies we don't know which company's sessions to update, unless we have a company_id. So in order for the company's sessions to be updated, the user update has to contain the company object.\nCompany data must be sent as part of the user ping in order for the company web session to increase.\nThe \u201ccompany last seen\u201d value is only updated when there is a\nping request\nwith the user. If your user logs in with just user data, then only \"last seen\" for the user will be updated, and not \"company last seen\".\nHow does Intercom track first and last name of my users?\nIntercom will automatically split your name attribute into first name and last name. For example:\nIf name is \"Joe Bloggs\", Intercom tracks it as First name: \"Joe\", Last name: \"Bloggs\".\nIf name is \"M\u00c1RCIA HELENA MAIA DE LIMA\", Intercom tracks it as First name: \"M\u00c1RCIA\" Last name: \"HELENA MAIA DE LIMA\"\nIf name is \"Dr. Drew Bloggs\", Intercom tracks it as First name: \"Drew\" Last name: \"Bloggs\"\nIf name is \"Joe Bloggs, CBA\", Intercom tracks it as First name: \"Joe\" Last name: \"Bloggs\" - \"CBA\" will still be shown in Joe's full name in Intercom.\nIf name is \"Bloggs, Joe\", Intercom tracks it as First name: \"Joe\" Last name: \"Bloggs\"\nIf name is \"Dr Bloggs\", Intercom tracks First name as \"doesn't exist\" Last Name \"Bloggs\"\nTo set a middle name, use the format: \"Last name, First name Middle name\". If name is \"Bloggs, Joe Drew\", Intercom tracks First name as: \"Joe Drew\" Last name: as \"Bloggs\"\nIf a user hasn't provided a name, we'll use their email address or user_id to identify them. If these fields are also blank, we'll generate a unique pseudonym for them, in the format: \"Color Object from Location\" like \"Pink Stereo from Atlanta\".\nHow does Intercom track if a user is currently online?\nIntercom uses real-time presence to record whether a user is currently online in your app. Real-time presence works based on periodic heartbeat requests coming from the user (via the Messenger).\nThe user sends those heartbeats every 30 seconds and is marked as offline when we haven't had a heartbeat in 2 minutes. Even at the lowest levels we don't always immediately detect the loss of connection as soon as the user closes the browser - it still often takes the absence of some sort of heartbeat traffic after a timeout interval to declare that the connection has dropped. Users navigating from page to page would flash on and offline constantly if we could reliably detect connections dropping and didn't smooth things out a little.\nHow does the user list update in real time?\nReal-time user presence will update the green dot shown next to a user or lead's profile picture:\nWhen your user list automatically refreshes, it doesn't bring in new people, it just refreshes the online status (the green dot) of who is already there. You will need to manually refresh to bring in new users, or update other values.\n\u200b\nHow do I create filters for dates in the future?\nIf you want to create\nfilters\nfor dates in the future, you need to use negative numbers.\nFor example, if you want to send an auto message to customers 3 days before their subscription ends, you would create a \"subscription_ends_at\" custom attribute and filter for \"more than -3 days ago\" and \"less than 0 days ago.\" This will match all users whose subscription is about to end in 3 days time.\nImportant:\nTo ensure this works, the custom attribute must be sent to Intercom as a Unix Timestamp and the type must be set to 'Date'.\nCustom attributes ending with \"_at\" are automatically treated as a date, rather than a number. However, if you named your custom attribute differently, you can change the type to 'Date' manually in your app settings under 'People Attributes'.\nIf you're using the 'exactly x days ago' filter we'll find users who match this filter during a 24 hour period. For example, 'signed_up_at exactly -3 days' ago will find users whose signed_up_at date is 2-3 days from now (and not 3-4 days from now).\nCan I filter for users on iPad devices in Intercom?\nNo, it's not possible to filter specifically for users on iPad devices within Intercom. This is because Apple uses the same OS identifier for both desktop (Mac devices) and iPad devices, so Intercom cannot distinguish between the two device types. This limitation is consistent across all filtering in Intercom, including: Contacts, Messages, Workflows, Reports, etc.\nWhat default custom attributes are available on my workspace?\nThe list of default custom attributes is:\nName\nAccount\nAccount name\nOwner\nOwner name\nLead category\nConversation rating\nEmail\nEmail domain\nPhone\nUser ID\nFirst seen\nSigned up\nLast seen\nLast contacted\nLast heard from\nLast opened email\nLast clicked on link in email\nWeb sessions\nCountry\nRegion\nCity\nTimezone\nContinent code\nCountry code\nBrowser language\nLanguage override\nBrowser\nBrowser sessions\nOS (operating system)\nPerson tag\nUnsubscribed from email\nMarked email as spam\nHas hard bounced\nUTM Campaign\nUTM Content\nUTM Medium\nUTM Source\nUTM Term\nReferral URL\nSubscription type opt-ins\nLast survey received\nWhatsapp number\nCompanies\nPhone number country\nTroubleshooting\nWhat can I do if I receive a \"user already exists\" error message?\nIf you've receive a \"user already exists\" error message due to an existing contact having the same email address or User ID/external_id, you can locate the existing contact by using the Intercom ID returned in the error message and making a GET call to the\nGet a contact\nAPI endpoint to return the existing user profile.\nFor example, if the error message contains\n\"message': 'A contact matching those details already exists with id=65a92b7ee1a4176d9ab8b357\"\n, you can make a\nGet a contact\nrequest to\nhttps://api.intercom.io/contacts/65a92b7ee1a4176d9ab8b357\n.\nWhy are my users coming through the Messenger with no names and saying they no longer match the filters?\nThis behavior occurs when booting unidentified users in mobile. It appears that neither an email address nor a user ID is being passed when booting the messenger for those users on mobile, which makes them unidentified users with no saved user data. To fix this, look at your SDK installation to make sure that email/user_id is being passed when users sign in to your app. You can review these docs for more info on identifying users on mobile:\niOS\nand\nAndroid\n.\n\"The Person has a Company Email Address and Cannot be Edited\"\nInstructions to resolve:\n1. Remove the user's email address from the \"Company addresses to ignore in group conversations\" list in your Email Forwarding\nsettings\n.\n2. After removing the email address from the list, you should be able to edit the user's name.\n3. Once you've made the necessary changes, you can add the email address back to the list if required.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHubSpot app\nMarketo app: Send leads to Marketo and trigger campaigns automatically\nMerge lead and user profiles\nMobile SDK - FAQs\nGroup your leads by Qualification Company"},

By default, Intercom comes with some basic attributes such as name, phone number, email, etc. You can also add your own\ncustom data attributes\ndepending on the needs of your business. Examples include:\nTier or plan that the user is on\nLast invoice amount\nLast item purchased\nCompany data attributes\nSimilar to people data attributes, company attributes are used to provide more data about the companies your business deals with via Intercom. Some default attributes include company name, industry, company website and ID. You can always create more custom attributes, for example:\nCompany tax/VAT ID\nNumber of employees\nWhether a company is a subsidiary or not\nConversation/ticket attributes\nThese are great for storing data about the\nticket\nor\nconversation\nthat your support team is working on, whether that is to give more context on a customer's issue or for categorization and reporting purposes. Examples of conversation/ticket data attributes include:\nCategory or reason for customer query\nProduct customer is contacting about\nFollow up needed (true / false)\nTemporary attributes\n[NEW]\nWorkflows and\nFin Tasks\ncan use a new type of attribute called a \"temporary attribute\".\nTemporary attributes are useful when you need data only for the current workflow and don't want to save it permanently in Intercom for reporting or other purposes. You can create these attributes to hold information that's relevant to the specific workflow being executed.\nFor example you can create a temporary attribute to:\nCapture a customer's selected booking ID\nCustomer\u2019s preferred delivery date\nAsk Fin to classify user query or collect some data\nWhere can attributes be used?\nFin Tasks\n[beta]\nYou can set up Fin Tasks and ask Fin to use any people, company, conversation, or temporary attributes by inserting these attributes into the Instructions steps using the @ commands.\nFrom this menu, you can pick different types of attributes listed under the different category headers:\nYou can also create temporary attributes using the @ commands. To create a new attribute using the \u2018@update attribute\u2019 command. Attributes are used to store transient information for the duration of the Task execution.\nFor example, you might instruct Fin to classify a user's query and save this as a temporary data attribute:\n\"Update: attribute with a summary after troubleshooting\u201d.\nRead more tips and best practices for Fin Tasks\n.\nFin Tasks currently support people, company, conversation, and temporary attributes, but not Ticket attributes.\nTemporary attributes can also be used in steps outside your Instructions, like branching, notes, and other common Task steps.\nCollecting data in a Workflow or Fin Task\nIf you wish to collect data and store it for the user, company, conversation or just temporarily in your\nWorkflow\nor\nFin Task\n, you can do so by using the \u201cCollect data\u201d step. This is useful if you want to later use the collected data to create conditional logic in the Workflow / Fin Task using branching.\nHere, you can specify what type of data attribute you would like to collect.\nData connectors\nData connectors\ncan retrieve or update data in an external system using data attributes.

However, sign up forms can also be used by malicious parties to send spam, with a tactic called \u201cList Bombing\u201d. List Bombing can pollute your user list and damage your deliverability. This can prevent your emails landing in your customers\u2019 inboxes, and lead to spam complaints, or even being blocked from sending altogether.\nWhat happens when you're list bombed?\nList bombing occurs when a malicious party uses bots to sign up to your product hundreds or thousands of times. They use email addresses they don\u2019t own and will often enter spam or phishing websites into the name field on your signup form. They are attempting to trick your platform into sharing their spam for them.\nHow list bombing affects you\nWhen someone list bombs your site, not only do they corrupt your data, polluting your workspace with invalid users, but they also can severely damage your email deliverability.\nIf you have a welcome campaign set up for new users, messages can be triggered to the fake users that were created. This can result in\nbounces\nand\nspam complaints\n, or worse, spam folder placement or blocklisting for all of your email.\nCombating a list bombing attack\nIf you notice you\u2019ve been list bombed or we\u2019ve reached out about it, don\u2019t panic! For your Intercom workspace, simply remove those users from Intercom. You can filter for users that were created around the time of the list bombing and\narchive them\n. Users will generally have similar names or similar email domains. When you\u2019re able to pinpoint the common denominator, simply remove all of the users that look similar. If you need help with this, reach out to our support team in the Messenger.\nHow can I prevent list bombing?\nUse confirmed opt-in: A confirmed opt-in process sends an email with a unique link to new signups. Once they\u2019ve clicked the link, you can verify that they are a real user who owns the address they\u2019ve signed up with, and at that point, you can begin sending them welcome email. List bombers won\u2019t be able to verify that address, and will be prevented from causing damage.\nImplement a reCAPTCHA:\nreCAPTCHA\nutilizes technology to determine if a human is using your platform. It can require entering a series of numbers or checking a specific box to prove that the person signing up is a real person.\nList bombing bots are generally unable to bypass a reCAPTCHA, which would prevent them from signing up.\nList bombing can be a very damaging attack on your user base and deliverability, but once you\u2019ve implemented protections against this, your app will be in a much safer place. \ud83d\ude04\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow do I avoid spam traps?\nProtect your workspace from high bounce rates\nEmail sending restrictions explained\nPermission guidelines for email marketing\nYour guide to Google & Yahoo\u2019s new requirements for email senders"},

Please note that if you use DD/MM/YYYY you can't send us the time.\nCSV imports also allow you to create custom user attributes (include a column for each).\nMixpanel includes last_seen.\nMailChimp imports the user's IP.\nGet started\nFirst, log in to your Intercom account and click 'New users or leads' from the people list.\nThen, select 'Import people':\nNext, choose the method you want to use to import users and follow the import steps.\nYou can also access all of these options in\nSettings > Data > Imports & exports\n:\nIf you import users into Intercom and they immediately match the criteria for a message that you have live, they will get that message right away.\nHow to import users from a CSV\nStep-by-step:\nIf you've selected the CSV import option, simply complete the following steps to import your users:\nComplete steps 1 and 2 outlined above in the 'Import users any time section'. Make sure you click\nOpen CSV Import tool\n.\nSelect\nImport users\nto import a list of logged-in users or customers of your product. Or choose \u2018Import leads\u2019 to import a list of leads into your Intercom workspace.\nDrag and drop your CSV file and Click\nUpload\n. The maximum file size limit is 20 mb. You should break up the file if it's larger than that.\nImportant CSV Format Requirements:\nThe user ID column must be formatted as\nuser_id\n(lowercase with underscore)\nYou can identify users using either:\nuser_id\n(recommended)\nEmail column\nIf both are present,\nuser_id\ntakes priority\nuser_id\nis required if no email is provided\nInconsistent use of user ID and email as identifiers can lead to the creation of duplicate users. For optimal results:\nEnsure every record includes both a user ID and an email whenever possible.\nRemember that the user ID is prioritized if both are supplied, which helps prevent duplicate accounts.\nBest Practice: Include both\nuser_id\nand Email columns in your CSV file for optimal user management.\n\u200b\n4. Intercom will now prompt you to select the relevant columns that contain your users\u2019 email addresses, IDs, full names and dates of sign-up. Click \u2018Select this column\u2019 for each and click \u2018Confirm.\nAll users or leads in your CSV must have an email address. Duplicate entries may occur when leads and users with the same email are treated as separate entities. To prevent this, ensure synchronization of user and lead data during imports.\n5. If you have added additional columns, Intercom will prompt you to give your custom attributes a specific name. Click 'Confirm' once you have named your custom attribute.\n6. Tag your CSV list with a memorable term such as \u2018New Sign-Ups 2015\u2019\n7. Once imported, you can search your Intercom User list for \u2018tag: New Sign-Ups 2015.\u2019 Now you\u2019re ready to do things like\nsend a one-off message\nto everyone on the list or\ncreate a segment\nfor that group and\nsend them a targeted Proactive support message\n.\nYou'll need to add the country calling code to the start of your phone numbers. For example, for US numbers you would add '+1' or '001'.\nCan I update user data with a CSV import?\nYes. You can update values, and add new attributes for existing users. All CSV imports require you to have a column with user email addresses. A few things to note:\nYou can update the email of a user by sending the same user_id and different email address. We'll update the user with that user_id in Intercom to reflect the new email address.\nYou can't update the user_id by setting a new value for it and using the existing email address - that would create a new record.\nIf you use both user_id and email in Intercom, sending email in a CSV import is enough to match the user record in Intercom.\nImport users via Rest API\nIt's possible to import users, along with custom user attributes, via the\nREST API\n. Once you've imported users, you can also add historical event data for your users via the\nEvents API\n.\nCheck out this\ntutorial\nwhich covers how to import contact user and lead data from a JSON file using the Intercom APIs.\nSee your Data Import History\nYou can see your data Import history in settings section in Intercom.\nWhat does the \"Multiple records match\" error mean?\nThe \"multiple records matched\" error typically occurs when there are multiple users in your system with the same email address. This creates a conflict because the system cannot determine which user to update. To resolve this, you'll need to ensure that each user has a unique email address or user ID.\nUnderstanding the causes of duplicate users\nInconsistent User Identifiers\n:\nIf email and user ID are used inconsistently, duplicates may occur. Email serves as a unique identifier only if no user ID is provided. Therefore, two users can share the same email if they have different user IDs. This might happen after backend updates or changes in user ID generation.\nIntegration Behaviors\n:\nApp integrations such as Shopify may create users where no hard match exists, using the email ID as a unique identifier instead of reconciling user IDs.\nMatching Logic During Uploads\n:\nIf only a user ID or email address is provided during imports, Intercom attempts to match on the provided field. However, discrepancies can occur when both fields are mismatched or inconsistently assigned.\nUsers and Leads Overlap\n:\nLeads and users are treated as different objects, even when sharing the same email address, potentially leading to duplicates.\nPrevention of duplicate users\nStandardize User Identifiers:\nEnsure that your setup consistently assigns both user ID and email values. For instance:\nIf only an email is provided, the system matches based on email.\nIf only a user ID is provided, the system matches based on the user ID.\nWhen both are provided, user ID takes precedence; if no match exists by user ID, the system matches on the email.\nVerify Lead Conversion Settings:\nUse consistent user IDs during sign-ins to convert active leads into users without duplication. Refer to our\nuser authentication guide\nfor further steps.\nReview Backend Processes:\nAnalyze your backend systems for updates or configurations that might generate unnecessary user IDs or fail to properly synchronize identifier fields.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall Intercom for users on web\nTracking user data in Intercom\nCreate new Leads and Users in Intercom\nHow do I filter an outbound message audience from a CSV file?\nImport your Zendesk ticket, user and organization data"},

So we made it easy for you to get to know each user personally. All you need to do is check out their user profile pages to see things like what plan they\u2019re on, where they live, what actions they have or haven\u2019t taken in your product, and lots more.\nTo get a personal picture of any individual user or company, simply click on their user name (or company name).\nFind answers to questions about any user\nWho are they?\nYou\u2019ll see lots of useful information about your user in the \u2018About\u2019 column on the left-hand side of their profile. This is great for quickly checking information about a particular user like how recently they\u2019ve been active, what language they speak or how many web sessions they've had.\nAnd, if you have sent Intercom any\ncustom user attributes\n(for example, the plan your user is on) you\u2019ll see that here too.\nWhen was your user last active?\nIf a user is online right now you\u2019ll see a green dot next to their avatar. And if they\u2019re not online now, you can check their \u2018Last Seen\u2019 time in the left-hand column. You can even see what segments your user belongs to so you\u2019ll know if they\u2019re \u2018New\u2019, \u2018Active, or if they belong to any custom segments that you\u2019ve created.\nHave they taken a specific action in your product? When, and how many times?\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether a user has taken a specific action (\nwe call these events\n) you can check the left-hand side of their profile. Assuming you\u2019ve sent the correct event data to Intercom, you can see when a user has bought an item, for example. And by clicking on the event, you can view any metadata you\u2019ve recorded about that event like the name and date of the purchase, for example.\nAre your users part of a specific group?\nIntercom lets you group your users together into useful groups by\ntagging users or creating custom segments\n. You can view any tags you (or any of your teammates) have added about your user in the left hand side of their profile. For example, you can quickly see if your user is tagged as a \u2018testimonial candidate\u2019, a \u2018beta customer\u2019 or a \u2018VIP customer\u2019.\nYou can also check if your user has been added to any custom segments you have created. For example, your user might belong to your \u2018trial user\u2019, \u2018hot prospect' or \u2018pro-plan\u2019 segment,\nas long as they match the criteria you set for that segment\n.\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with a user?\nIf your team members have left any useful notes about your user you can see it in the left-hand side of that profile. This is great for leaving additional context about a person for the rest of your team who might look at this page later. You might want to add an internal note when a customer is considering upgrading their plan, for example. Or you might want to let your team know that a particular user is a good friend of your company, if they\u2019re a good candidate for a round of beta testing, or if you had a call with them where they were particularly unhappy about something.\nPro tip:\nYou or any of your teammates can edit an internal note that has been added to your user's profile. Just hover your mouse over the end of the note and you'll see the option to 'Edit.'\nFind answers to questions about any company\nCompany profiles give you an overview of the state of your relationship with each company at a glance. For example, you can see if the company is new, active or slipping away, how long they\u2019ve been a customer, how many session counts they have, when they last logged in and much more.\nWhat plan are they on and how are they using your product?\nOn the left side of any company profile you can view information about the company\u2019s account and how they\u2019re using your product. You\u2019ll be able to see things like what plan they\u2019re on, their monthly spend, how many people in the company are using your product, when they were \u2018Last Seen\u2019 and more. If you have sent any custom company attributes to Intercom you\u2019ll see this data here too.\nWhat role does a user hold in a company?\nWhen you view any company profile you will see a list of the users that work at that company. You can click into that user\u2019s profile and tag them as an \u2018Admin\u2019, \u2018Marketer\u2019, \u2018Developer\u2019, \u2018CTO\u2019 or whatever title they hold. Then, if you want to check whether you\u2019re talking to the Marketer or CTO of the company you can simply check the the tags in your user\u2019s profile.\nWhat's your relationship with a company?\nWhen something important happens with a company you want to be able to record an internal note about that company so that all your of colleagues are aware of it. For example, if a company has raised a new round of funding you can let your colleagues know by leaving an internal note.

You can:\nManually qualify your leads in the Inbox as you chat to them, or\nSet up automations to qualify leads on your behalf, based on whatever data is most important for your business.\nBefore you do either, you\u2019ll need to define the qualification data that\u2019s most useful to collect about your leads. The data you add, should help your Sales team quickly identify and focus on promising prospects.\nYou\u2019ll need access to the Inbox to qualify your leads.\nDefine the characteristics of your ideal customer\nFirst, sit down with your team and define the characteristics of your ideal customer. Here are some questions to guide you:\nWhat\u2019s their goal for using your product?\nDo they have a specific role in an organization? For example, are they a CEO or a marketer?\nDo they work in a specific industry?\nHow big is their company?\nDo they work for a B2B or B2C company?\nDo they work in a specific location?\nWhat scale do they want to use your product?

For example:\nText is great if you want your leads to describe their answer\n(like their job title or goal for using your product) in their own words.\nNumbers are great for identifying lucrative, larger companies.\nFor example, you can assess the size of a company and the amount they have to spend, etc.\nLists are great if you want your leads to choose from a number of pre-defined items.\nFor example, you can ask whether your leads work for a B2B or B2C company. Keep your list simple and don\u2019t give too many options to choose from.\nTrue or false questions help you check whether your leads have something that\u2019s key to using your product.\nFor example if you have a mobile messaging app, you can check if your leads have a mobile phone.\nIf you\u2019d like to edit a qualification attribute you\u2019ve added to your list, just click on that attribute.

This understanding lets you send targeted, relevant messages and gives you all the context you need to support your customers.\nIntercom tracks some events by default, like page views and interactions with your Help Center, this article is about tracking your own custom events.\nThere are many ways to send events to Intercom:\nThe Intercom JavaScript API\n.\nGoogle tag manager\n.\nVia the REST API\n.\nThrough our\nmobile SDKs\n.\nWith apps & integrations like Stripe or Segment\n.\nEvent Metadata\nEvery event you track can also include metadata. This is additional information about each specific occurence of the event. E.g.: If you track a \u201cpurchase\u201d event, the metadata could be the name and price of the item purchased.\nEach event can be sent with up to twenty pieces of metadata. The following types of data are supported:\nString:\nA plain string up to 255 characters long.\nNumber:\nPositive or negative number.\nDate:\nA\ntimestamp\nwhich we'll show as a human readable date. (Note: this is in Intercom only. If you use\nmetadata\nas part of Proactive support messages, these values will not be formatted.)\nLink:\nAn http or https url, which we'll create a link to.\nRich link:\nAn http or https link, also sent with a title, which we'll create a link to.\nImage:\nAn http or https link to an image, which we'll display.\nStripe (retail):\nA Stripe invoice, customer or charge identifier, which we'll create a link to.\nMonetary (retail):\nAn amount with a currency.\nImportant:\nKey names are case insensitive, and can\u2019t contain periods ('.'), dollar signs ('$'), characters like ~`!@#%^&*'{}|\\'\" or the NULL character.\nDashes in key names are not displayed in Intercom. The key is still important for tracking data, while 'invited-friend' and 'invited friend' will both be displayed as Invited friend in the UI, the two fields represent different data.\nRead on to learn how to send events with each method. Or,\nskip to this overview of tracking an event from start to finish\n.\nThe Intercom JavaScript API\nWith the Intercom JavaScript snippet installed in your app or on your website, you can submit events when your users or visitors take actions.\nUse the Intercom(\u2018trackEvent\u2019) method. This automatically associates the event with the currently tracked\nvisitor, lead or user\nand sends it to Intercom.  A simple event would look like this:\nThis would be tracked like this:\nIntercom('trackEvent', \u2018upload-complete');\nOptionally, you can also include metadata with the event for more granular targeting of\nevent based messages\n, and inclusion in message content:\nThis event with metadata:\nvar metadata = {\nduration: 19,\ntype: \"JPEG\",\nfile_location: \"https://external-content.com/example.jpg\"\n};\nIntercom('trackEvent', 'upload-complete');\nNote:\nTo track events with the JavaScript API you\u2019ll need to ensure that the Intercom JavaScript snippet has already successfully loaded on the page.\nTo Install Intercom, copy\nthe first code snippet in your web installation settings\n, which is pre-populated with your\nworkspace ID\n. Then paste the code right before the closing\n<body/>\ntag of any page where you want to track events.\nGoogle Tag Manager\nIf you\u2019ve installed Intercom with Google tag manager, you can use it to track custom events, like this\nexample from our help article\n, which tracks an event for \u201cExit intent\u201d. This is perfect for messages you want to send to your site visitors, like example.\nDirectly via the REST API\nYou can track events directly via the REST API, using the language of your choice, or one of our supported SDKs:\nPHP\nNode\nRuby\nGo\nJava\n.NET\nWhen tracking an event with the REST API, you can also specify a \u201ccreated_at\u201d time to define specifically when it took place, which allows you to \u201ccatch up\u201d on events that occurred historically.\nSee our\nAPI Documentation\nfor more details.\nNote:\nEvents tracked via the API, won\u2019t trigger Banners or Carousels. For these message types, we recommend using the JavaScript api, or one of our mobile SDKs.\nFrom your mobile app using one of our mobile SDKs\nYou can use any of our mobile SDKs to set up event tracking:\niOS\nAndroid\nCordova/Phonegap\nWith an app like Segment or Stripe.\nVarious apps from our\napp store\n, will track events for you in Intercom. For example,\nthe Stripe app\nwill track subscription events like recent payments. This is perfect for\nsending notification messages about account activity\n.\nBrowse \u201cData and enrichment\u201d apps in our app store to find more options\n.\nEvent tracking in action\nFor this example, we\u2019ll track an event with the JavaScript API whenever a customer\u2019s upload is complete, then send them a message each time that happens.\nFirst, the code we need:\nThis JavaScript tracks an event called \u201cUpload complete\u201d and includes:\nThe file location\n- \u201c/example.jpg\u201d\nThe type\n- \u201cJPEG\u201d\nAnd how long it took to upload (in minutes)\n- 19\nNow each time the event is tracked, it\u2019s visible in these places:\nThe user profile.\nIn the Help Desk (recent events).\nIn your message filters.\nFilters on the contact list.\nNote:\nWhen someone first contacts you and is added as a lead in Intercom, you can see any events they\u2019ve tracked\nas a visitor\nin the last 90 days before getting in touch.\nFrom\nSettings > Data > People\nand under the Events tab we\u2019ll\nadd a description\nto the event so it\u2019s super clear for all our teammates what it represents:\nNow with the event tracked successfully, we can use event based messaging to\nsend them a notification banner\neach time it occurs. Read this article to learn all about\nevent based messaging\n.\nHow do I delete events?\nFrom your\nworkspace\u2019s event settings\n, open the event and click 'Archive':\nYou can always unarchive an event later if you change your mind, but archived events aren't recreated if you track them again.\nBelow is an example of how you would set up a Rich Link:\nvar metadata = {\norder_number: {url: \"https://example.com/tx186373\", value: \"TX186373\"},\n};\nIntercom('trackEvent', 'order', metadata);\nIn the above example we are sending the\nhttps://example.com/tx186373\nlink in the metadata for the 'order' Event with a title which will create a link to the URL you sent.\nWhen the above event is sent for a particular user they will see the order_number attribute with a value of TX186373 but the link will be embedded on that value.\nBest practices for capturing events\nEvents are most useful for filtering and segmenting your users, and sending targeted messages to your customers.\nWith that in mind, we have some recommendations on how to get the most out of Events:\nSend events which capture meaningful actions\n. A purchase is a great basis for a conversation as opposed to recording all the clicks that lead up to that purchase. Meaningful events will also make creating filters and auto-messages much easier.\nSend the right amount of metadata\n. Metadata is a great way to contextualise activity, but sending too much can be distracting. Remember that you can always link back to your own systems for more details.\nFormat your metadata as if it were to be sent to a customer.\nMetadata is not formatted when included in your messages, so it must be ready to go when it\u2019s received by Intercom.\nUse events to understand user to user interactions\nlike invitations and social activity. You can use metadata to provide a rich view of how users are interacting with your business and each other.\nName your events in a way that makes them easily readable\nin Intercom. Using a past tense verb is one way to make the action more easily understood when it appears in the user activity timeline e.g. \"\nPurchased\nitem\", \"\nCreated\nprofile\" or \"\nViewed\nonboarding guide\".\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nThe Intercom JavaScript API\nRecord customer activity with event tracking\nInstall Intercom with Google Tag Manager\nSend repeatable messages based on events you track in Intercom\nEvent Limits, Troubleshooting and F.A.Q"},

Once you start tracking events in Intercom, you can filter your customers and send them messages based on their actions, including:\nWhen they\u2019ve taken an action a certain number of times.\nEach time they take an action (transactional, notification messages)\n.\nThe first time they take an action.\nWhen it has been \u201cX days\u201d since the last time they took an action.\nYou can track actions that your logged-in users, and logged-out visitors are taking. For example, you could track:\nThe most recent time a user performed an action. For example, the last time they exported a PDF, or visited your help center.\nThe first time a user opted for a paid plan, or used a discount code.\nEach time a user invites someone else to your service.\nWhen (and what) someone ordered on your site.\nNote:\nThe events described here are just examples, and may require assistance from an engineer or developer to implement. It's simple and there are many\nmethods\nfor doing it successfully.\nThese are just some of the ways you can use events to better segment your customers based on their actions and send them behavior-based messages.\nNote\n: It's only possible to view events from the last 90 days within Intercom or via the API. However, you can still filter and message users based on events older than 90 days. This will not affect the first/last occurred dates if they are over 90 days ago.\nEvents vs custom attributes\nA\ncustom attribute\nis data you track about your customers, e.g., how many projects they\u2019ve created in your product.

You can view that as a plain event, or add context to the event by tracking some metadata with it, such as:\nNew plan\nOld plan\nBilling period\nNote:\nYou can track up to 20 key-value pairs as metadata.\nYou could use an event like this to send a message that thanks a user for upgrading, and links to a\nProduct Tour\nof the new features they can access:\nProduct feature usage\nBy tracking events when your customers use new features, you can conduct product research and contact them to ask \"what worked well?\" or \"what could be improved?\".\nPurchase\nIn this example, we\u2019ve tracked an event when a customer has made a purchase. This allows you to ask for a review and include event metadata in the message.

You can also use it as\nqualification data\nto qualify leads and trial users\nWhat\u2019s a custom data attribute?\nA custom data attribute (CDA) tracks\nfacts\nabout your customers \u2014 like the plan someone is on, or when they signed up \u2014 as opposed to an\nevent,\nwhich tracks recurring customer\nactions\n.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nIf your product is a project management tool, you could track data about the number of files each user has. Then, if you want to message users who haven\u2019t started adding files to the tool and might need some help onboarding, you could set up a message targeted to users with \"files less than 1\".\nThe most common CDAs set up on Intercom are about customer development, such as:\nPrice plan\nValue of purchases\nNumber of teammates added\nNumber of songs played\nDate subscription ends\nImportant:\nThe\nsigned_up\nvalue should be sent to Intercom through your integration. This value indicates the time a user signed up for your service.\nYou can choose to update the value by:\nsending us the\ncreated_at\nparameter\ntimestamp\nin the intercomSettings snippet.\nsetting the value for\nsigned_up_at\nif you're using our\nREST API\n.\nusing a\nCSV import\n, by mapping one of the imported columns as Signed Up date.\nIntercom will automatically set the value for the\nsigned_up\ndate only in the following cases:\nSDKs (Android/iOS) and unidentified\nusers\nusers created through JS snippet with no\ncreated_at\nvalue\nIn those cases, users will have the signed up time set to the time of the creation request. In all other cases the value would have to be set by you.\nCreate custom data attributes\nTo create a new attribute in Intercom, go to\nSettings > Data > People\nand click\n+ Create attribute\n. Give your new attribute a name, a description, select the type of data it will store.\nPrevent attribute updates via the Messenger\nYou can choose whether the attribute can be updated via the Messenger. If the selection to \"Prevent updates via the Messenger\" is chosen, then any request to update this attribute from the Messenger on web, mobile or via the\nJavascript API\nwill be silently ignored.\nAll attributes that don't have this selection checked will still be updated as normal. This setting can be toggled on or off by updating the attribute and it does not affect updates from other sources like our Public API, CSV Imports, etc.\nNote:\nWe recommend that you\ndisallow\ninsecure attribute updates or creation via the Messenger, to prevent unauthorised updates to your data. You can then setup\nMessenger Security with JWTs\nto securely update those fields via the Messenger.\nThis setting only applies to CDAs, it cannot be enabled for standard attributes.\nCDAs are only protected from insecure updates via the Messenger if the setting is turned on for each individual CDA.\nClick save and the attribute will be added to your attributes list. It won't be populated for any of your customers yet, you'll need to send it to Intercom via the JavaScript snippet, the API, or an app from our app store. \ud83d\udc4c\nIf you need to change the format or description of the attribute you just created, you can edit it and make the change:\nThe name of the custom data attribute cannot be changed after it's created. You will need to\narchive\nthe existing attribute and create a new one.\nUpdate custom attributes via the Messenger\nCustom data attributes can be updated using the Messenger Javascript code snippet.\nWhen updating custom attributes via the messenger,\ndouble check that your keys always have a JSON-valid value\nthat is a string (text), number, or boolean (true or false). That means using double quotes around text strings and sending NULL to cater for cases when no value exists for a user.\nYou can also send us dates or URLs. You can track URLs as a text string, e.g. \"\nhttp://www.google.com\n\". Intercom will recognize this and automatically turn it into a hyperlink. Track dates by sending us\na unix timestamp in seconds\n. If you create a key name that ends with \u201c_at\u201d we'll automatically treat it as a date rather than a number (see \u00a0\"last_order_at\" \u00a0below).\nFind out how dates work in Intercom here\n.\nEnsure that you're passing UNIX in seconds and not milliseconds.\nHere are some examples of data attribute key and value pairs:\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\nemail: \"bob@example.com\",\nuser_id: \"123\",\napp_id: \"abc1234\",\ncreated_at: 1234567890,\n\"subdomain\": \"intercom\", // Put quotes around text strings\n\"teammates\": 4, // Send numbers without quotes\n\"active_accounts\": 12,\n\"last_order_at\" : 1350466020, // Send dates in unix timestamp format and end key names with \"_at\"\n\"custom_domain\": null // Send null when no value exists for a user\n}\nDifferent types of CDAs you can send to Intercom\nString (ie words) Ex. URLs, plan name, user type, etc.\nNumber (integer)\nBoolean (true / false)\nTime Stamp (the date and time something happens) e.g. \"converted_at\"\nThings to remember:\nKey names\nare case sensitive, and can\u2019t contain periods ('.'), dollar signs ('$'), characters like ~`!@#%^&*'{}[]|\\'\" or the NULL character. \u2014\nIf an unsupported character is used, the attribute will be created with an underscore in its place.\nData values\nmust be sent as JSON strings, numbers or booleans (true or false). We can\u2019t accept object, nested hashes and array data formats.\nText string values\ncan only hold up to 255 characters.\nYou can\nclear existing data\nvalues by sending empty strings.\nIntercom automatically tracks a number of\nstandard attributes\n. Check these before creating custom attributes.\nSoft limit is 250 active CDA's.\nOnce you\u2019ve updated your code snippet and started tracking the data, you should:\nTurn on identity verification\nfor your users.\nCreate descriptions\nfor each attribute to help your teammates understand them.\n\u200b\nImportant:\nWe receive our geo-location data based on the User's IP address from a third-party service, called\nMaxmind\n. We have no control over this data and it's not possible to update it through the API, but you can choose to file a data correction request through\nthis page\nif you believe it to be incorrect.\nAdditionally, it is possible that these users could be using a VPN, or they're traveling at the moment, which would explain why the location appears incorrect.\n\u200b\nIn regards to the \"region\" attribute: for the United States, \"\nregion\n\" will refer to\nState\n. With other countries it may vary - for example in Canada \"\nregion\n\" refers to\nProvince\n.\nYou can see a list of all region values and their abbreviations\nhere\n.\nOther methods\nIt's also possible to track and update custom attributes about your users, with\nCSV imports\n, Intercom's\nREST API\n, or many\nthird party applications\n.\nWhat is custom qualification data?\nQualification data is a special set of attributes you can manually update in your customer profiles as you qualify them. You can set these up via a simple form in Intercom. If you intend to update this data manually, you don\u2019t need to do anything else.\nIf you want to track this data via a ping, you need to add the key/value pairs to your\nintercomSettings\ncode snippet, just as you would with other custom data.\nTo create new custom qualification data, go to\nSettings > Data > People > Lead qualification\n.\nScroll down and click\nAdd data\nthen\n+ Create new data\nfrom the dropdown menu.\nHere you can create a name (that\u2019s your key) and choose a format for the values you\u2019ll collect (Text, Number, True or False, or List).\nIf you choose the List format, this not an array structure but rather a list of selections where values are predetermined.\nIt's possible to set the value of a list attribute to a value that you haven\u2019t manually configured for the list by using our REST API. This value will not get added as a permanent option for that list when manually changing the value however and may be lost if a teammate manually changes this value.\nFinally, you can add a description to help your teammates understand the data.\nChoose simple names for your custom qualification data. If you decide you want to qualify this data via the Messenger, customers will see these names in the Messenger.\n\u200b\nArchive data attributes\nCustom data attributes cannot be fully deleted, but you can archive them. Archived data won\u2019t appear as a filter in your user or lead lists, so it\u2019s a good way to clean up data you don\u2019t need.\n\u200b\nGo to\nSettings > Data > People\n.\n\u200b\nChoose a piece of data you'd like to archive. Click the edit icon next to it and then click\nArchive\nin the pop-up box. You can unarchive them if you change your mind, but you can\u2019t completely delete custom data attributes.\nTo find your archived custom attributes, just scroll to the bottom of the page.\nUnderstanding CDA limits and best practices\nCustom data attributes (CDAs) have workspace limits to maintain optimal performance.\nThere\u2019s a limit of 250 People and Company CDAs per workspace, but you can\narchive unused attributes\nto free up space.\nWhen creating new attributes, consider these best practices:\nCreate attributes that have broad application across users.\nAvoid creating attributes for one-off situations.\nConsider using\nEvents\nas an alternative for specific scenarios.\nUtilize tags when appropriate, as they don't have the same limitations.\nRegularly review your CDA usage to ensure efficient workspace management. If you need increased capacity after implementing optimization strategies, additional limit increases may be available upon request.\nIf you are sending data about your users via the Messenger,\nwe strongly recommend you secure your Messenger\n.

But sometimes you want answers to questions that are specific to your users and your product. You can send Intercom data specific to your userbase in two ways: custom data attributes and events.\nBelow, we share some best practice examples to help you customize Intercom to be about your users.\nWhat are custom data attributes and events?\nCustom data attributes is information you send us about your users. Events are different; they\u2019re specific actions your users take inside your product.\nFor example, if you\u2019ve a project management tool:\nA custom data attribute you send might be something like the number of projects a user has created or the name of their plan.\nWhile an event can tell you when your user upgrades their plan.\nMake Intercom to be about your users\nYou can\nsend any custom data attributes you like to Intercom\n. Custom data attributes are ideal for helping you answer questions like:\nHow many/how much?\ne.g. which users are paying you over $10 per month?\nWhat\u2019s the name?\ne.g. show me a list of all the users whose job title is \u2018Marketer\u2019\nIs it true or false?\ne.g. which users have used my calendar feature? (calendar feature = true) and which users haven\u2019t? (calendar feature = false)\nWhat date?\ne.g. which users\u2019 subscriptions are due to end on September 1st?\nCustom data attributes examples to send\nYou\u2019ll have questions specific to your userbase.\nSo you should send to Intercom whatever custom data attributes you need to answer them.\nAnd you should only send data that captures meaningful information about your users (like their monthly spend, the number of teammates they have added or the date their subscription ends).\nHere are a few common examples we see that you can take inspiration from:\nProject created\n- If you own a project sharing tool you will want to know which (and how many) users have or haven\u2019t created a project yet. This data tells you who needs help being successful with that feature.\nTo find out which users have yet to create a project, filter your User list to show everyone who has 0 projects created:\n(and woohoo, everyone has at least one project, great to know!)\nCalendar feature -\nYou might want to see a list of all your users who have used your Calendar feature in the past day. This would be a valuable group to ask for feedback.\nJob title -\nMaybe you want to see a list of all of the marketers using your product. You can tell this exact group of your users about your new analytics feature.\nMonthly spend -\nMaybe you want to find out which users are spending over $50 per month on their subscription. This would be a great group to give a thank you gift to.\n\u200b\nHere\u2019s how you would filter your User list for that:\nSongs uploaded -\nHow many users have uploaded over 80 songs, for example, out of a possible 100? If someone is closing in on a limit, they\u2019re a good contender for an upgrade, so you should let them know about your 500 song plan.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nEbook download -\nWhich users have downloaded your latest ebook? This content loving group could be interested in your latest blog post written about a similar topic.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nProduct purchased -\nMaybe you want to know who has purchased over 5 products from your store. You could then offer this group a gift for their loyalty like a discount off a future purchase.\nRemember, the above are just a few examples. You can\nsend Intercom whatever data makes sense to you\nfor better understanding your users.\nAdd descriptions to custom attributes\nYou can add a description to any custom attribute you create in Intercom. This will help both you and your teammates remember what your custom attributes mean.\nTrack actions that users take in your product\nTo track specific actions users take inside your product, you should\nsend events to Intercom\n. Events tell you the first time your user takes an action (for example, when a subscription was upgraded), the last time they take that action (e.g. the last time they exported a PDF) and the total amount of time they take an action (like the number of times a particular feature was used).

Below are some important things to remember when creating or updating company qualification data in Intercom.\nFor your new and existing users, we do not recommend attaching them to a Qualification Company, but rather\nattaching them to a Standard Company\nvia the JavaScript snippet or via the REST API.\nCreating a Qualification Company via the Inbox\nBy default, you\u2019ll see the following qualification data attributes under\nQualification\nin the right sidebar in the Inbox:\nCompany name\nCompany size\nCompany website\nCompany industry\nLearn how to define the right\nqualification data\nfor your business.\nIf a \"Company name\" is not present, this means the contact is not attached to an existing company in Intercom. Adding a new \"Company name\" here will create a new\nQualification Company\nin Intercom, and automatically attach the lead (or user) to the Qualification Company \ud83d\udc47\nA Qualification Company will also be created for a contact if you collect any Company attributes, like \"Company name\", using\nSimple automations\nor\nWorkflows\n(if the contact is not already attached to a company).\nOnce the Qualification Company is created, you'll find it in the lead's profile, as the\ncontact\nhas been attached to this company.\nNow, looking at the Qualification Company profile in Intercom, the main difference in a Qualification Company and a Standard Company is the \"\nCompany id\n\".\nWhen a Qualification Company is created, Intercom will automatically generate a \"Company id\", that will look something like this\n\ud83d\udc47\n659c7fd262a7af1c86c2e186-qualification-company\nSince this \"Company id\" is generated by Intercom, this makes the Qualification Company difficult to add users to via the REST API or JavaScript snippet. This is because you need to know the \"Company id\" and send it to Intercom with the user, to attach them to a company using these methods.\nA \"Company id\" cannot be changed after the company has been created.\nWhen a Standard Company is created via the\nJavaScript snippet\n(below) or via the\nREST API\n, Intercom requires the \"Company id\" to be generated from your end (not by Intercom). This makes the \"Company id\" much easier to keep track of when identifying users to Intercom, and attaching them to a company \ud83d\udc47\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\napp_id: \"abc123\",\nname: \"Alex User\",\nemail: \"alexuser@email.com\",\nuser_id: \"6789\",\ncompany: {\nid: \"54321\", // \"Company id\" is created from your end here\nname: \"Cinco\"\n}\n}\nHere's an example of a Standard Company in Intercom with \"Company id\" created via the JavaScript snippet \ud83d\udc47\nIf a company does not already exist in Intercom with this \"Company id\", a new Standard Company will be created using this \"Company id\" and the user will be attached.\nUpdating company attributes in the qualification data\nIf the contact is\nnot attached\nto an existing company, updating any company attributes in the qualification data will create a Qualification Company.\nFor example, adding a value for \"Company website\" would create a Qualification Company without a \"Company name\", with the contact attached.\nIf a contact is already attached to a company, updating a company attribute in the qualification data would update the value on the company object. For example, updating a \"Company name\" would change the name of the company for\nall\ncontacts that are attached to it.\nAdd a contact to an existing company via qualification data\nIt's possible to add a contact to an existing Qualification Company or Standard Company via the qualification data \"Company name\" attribute.\nNo indication will be shown in the UI to denote if the company is a Qualification Company (\"Company id\" generated by Intercom), or a standard Company (\"Company id\" generated from your end) \ud83d\udc47\nThis is one way that users can accidentally get attached to Qualification Companies, and leads can get attached to Standard Companies, so be mindful when adding a contact to an existing company.\nBest practices\nTry to keep your Qualification Companies limited to just leads that you are qualifying, and avoid adding any users to them.\nLikewise, try to not add leads to your existing Standard Companies, keep these companies reserved for users.\nWhile it is possible to add a user to a Qualification Company using the qualification data, or using the\n<numeric id>-qualification-company\nfor \"Company id\" in the JavaScript snippet, we do not recommend this practice.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall Intercom for visitors and leads on web\nGroup your users by company\nMarketo app: Send leads to Marketo and trigger campaigns automatically\nEdit and update data\nManually qualify leads as you chat"},

By default, Intercom treats all users as individuals, but the companies feature groups all the users from the same company together.\nWhy use the companies feature?\nIdentify groups of interest\nJust like with your user list, you can drill down into your companies list by filtering on standard or custom attributes to answer specific questions. These could be things like;\nWhich companies are all paying us more than $100 a month?\nWhich companies have more than 8,000 users?\nShow me a list of companies who are eligible for our next private beta round.\nOnce you've created these lists, you can save them as segments. For example, you could create a segment of companies who are on your highest plan, but have not been active in 30 days. Or, you could create a segment of companies who have all stopped using a particular feature.\nYou can also tag a company to manually add them to groups of interest (tags are similar to segments except that users are tagged manually, but are added to segments automatically).\nMessage a company\nOnce you've drilled down to identify the groups of interest, you can then send them targeted messages. So for example, you could set an auto message to go to everyone who gets added to the 'Stopped using feature x' segment. The message could link them up to start using again, or like in the example below, could simply be asking why they stopped.\nIf you use company attributes in an auto message it will cause the auto message to target anyone in that company. Users in more than one company will receive a separate message for each company.\nCompany profile page\nWhen you click into any given companies profile page, the first thing you'll notice is the company profile card which shows you things like where each member of the team is located, what plan the company is on, how many open conversations they have, and more.\nYou can see everything happening with that company in their activity stream.\nYou can see who everyone in the company is, and what they've been up to here in the users tab.\nYou can see all the conversations with that company here and you can reply here too.\nYou can leave notes about a company so that you and your team members have more context when they visit their profile page.\nGet started\nCompany information is sent over in the\nintercomSettings\ncode snippet, as a JSON object called\ncompany\n.\nYou need to\ndouble check that your company returns valid JSON (even when your database returns a null value);\nthis means double quotes around all keys and around all strings. Here's an example of how it will look:\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\nemail: \"example@example.com\",\ncreated_at: 1457552104,\napp_id: \"pi3243fa\",\ncompany: {\nid: \"123\",\nname: \"Intercorp\",\ncreated_at: 1234567890,\n// (optional): Insert name of the plan current company is on\nplan: \"pro\",\n// (optional): Insert amount current company spends a month\nmonthly_spend: 10,\n// (optional): Add any custom attributes, e.g.,\nupgraded_at: 1424941688\n}\n}\nNote:\nCompany ID and company name are the minimum requirements to pass a company into Intercom.\nCompany ID cannot be updated so be sure to use a unique value that won't change in future.\nYou'll need to \"Enable company related features throughout Intercom' in your\nGeneral settings\n. In addition, make sure that the feature 'Prevent company attribute updates on Messenger' is toggled off. This will ensure that users will associate with any new companies created.\nYou can also send Intercom company data with the\nREST API\n.\nNote:\nCompany data cannot be imported via CSV.\nSome company data can be edited in the UI, once the company attribute has been added to your qualification data.\nWhy do my company's have 0 web sessions or incorrect last seen date?\nIf you're seeing users with a value for their web session but their associated company's web sessions show up as 0, it could be because you're not identifying the company when logging the user in.\nWhen users log into your workspace you need to declare the company they are logging into along with their details.\n\u200b\ufeff\n\ufeffHere is an example of loading a user and attributing them with a company:\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\nemail: \"chris@cooldudes.biz\",\napp_id: \"pi3243fa\",\ncompany: {\nid: \"123\",\nname: \"Synergy Corp\",\n}\n}\nThe above includes the details of the company.  This means when the user logs in, their\nlast_seen\nvalue as well as the\nlast_seen\nvalue of the company would both update.\nIf you only passed the below, it would update the\nlast_seen\nattribute of the user but not the company:\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\nemail: \"chris@cooldudes.biz\",\napp_id: \"pi3243fa\",\n}\nHow to remove users from a company\nIt's easy to remove any user from a company profile. Just visit whatever company profile you'd like and select the user/users you'd like to remove. Then click the 'Remove' button.\nImportant information:\nCompanies will not appear within Intercom until users have been added or associated with a company. You can also\ncreate companies via the API\nif you like.\nYou should input only rounded integer values for the monthly_spend attribute in your company's data, as we automatically round any float values. For example, if your monthly spend is 10.4 you should round it to 10.\nIf a user is associated with multiple companies we don't know which company's sessions to update, unless we have a company ID. So in order for the company's sessions to be updated, the user update has to contain the company object.\nUsers can belong to multiple companies\n, but you should only send us the data for the company that the user is currently signed in with. You can also send other attributes within the company object. Those will be treated like custom attributes for that particular company.

Intercom already tracks some dates by default, such as when your users sign up, or are first seen on your website. Read more about the data that Intercom automatically tracks\nhere\n.\nYou can also send Intercom dates as\ncustom user attributes\n. For example, you could track the date that a user subscribed to one of your products, or the date they cancelled their subscription.\nOnce you\u2019re sending these date attributes to Intercom, you could send an\nProactive Support Message\nto users who cancelled a week ago, or send a\nProduct Tour\nto newly subscribed users to assist with their onboarding.\nTracking date attributes in Intercom\nThere are two ways to track date attributes in Intercom about your users:\n1. If you create a custom attribute name that ends with \u201c_at\u201d we'll automatically treat it as a date rather than a number (see \u00a0\"last_order_at\" \u00a0below).\nwindow.intercomSettings = {\nemail: \"bob@example.com\",\nuser_id: \"123\",\napp_id: \"abc1234\",\n\"last_order_at\" : 1350466020, // Send dates in unix timestamp format and end key names with \"_at\"\n}\n2. Alternatively, you can create date attributes from\nSettings > Data > People\nin your workspace.\nChoose the Date format when creating these attributes. When you start sending Intercom data for these attributes, make sure to either send the dates as a\nunix timestamp\nin seconds, or in a DD/MM/YYYY format.\nWe recommend that you\ndo not\nallow attribute updates or creation via the Messenger as this can be a security risk.\nLearn more here\n.\nWhat is a Unix timestamp and why is it needed?\nDate attributes should ideally be sent to Intercom as a\nUnix timestamp\n. Every\nprogramming language\nhas ways to calculate these timestamps. Intercom only accepts the timestamps in seconds, not in milliseconds. Intercom will also accept\nISO 8601\ntimestamps if generating a Unix one is troublesome.\nUnix timestamps are always the preferred format for date attributes in Intercom, as they provide a specific point in time, so they can be translated across timezones. If you don't know or can't generate the exact timestamp, you can also send Intercom date attributes in DD/MM/YYYY format. Then, filters such as \u201cSigned up more than 30 days ago\u201d will still work correctly - if not quite as specifically - for Proactive Support Messages, Workflows and more.\nWhat dates can I see in the Intercom app?\nThe dates displayed in your workspace will always be in your computer or device\u2019s timezone, which could be different from\nyour workspace\u2019s timezone.\nFor example, the date a user was first seen:\nOr, when a message was received by hovering over the channel icon in your inbox:\nYour\nworkspace\u2019s timezone\nis used for a number of reasons, such as when to send scheduled messages, or to determine your office hours, but it does not influence the dates you see in the Intercom UI.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall Intercom for users on web\nImport your user data into Intercom\nCreate and track custom data attributes (CDAs)\nInstall Intercom with Google Tag Manager\nHow to create tickets in Zendesk from a conversation in Intercom with Data connectors"},

While it can work, you may encounter errors when attempting to pull in too much data separated by pipes. You should set the filters up separately with an \"OR\" rule instead.\nYou can also combine filter groups using \u201cAnd\u201d / \u201cOr\u201d logic. Simply click\n+ Add filter\n(from Contacts) or\n+ Add audience rule\n(from a message) to create a new filter group.\nThen you can select whether to apply \u201cAnd\u201d / \u201cOr\u201d logic between the different filter groups.\nIf you're filtering your Contacts list, click\nSave segment\nso you can quickly come back to this list and select this segment for your message audience.\nCheck the rules\nEither get an example user to compare against the filters, or imagine you're a hypothetical user being checked against the rules.\nLook at the grouping\nbetween\nfilter groups; if it's an \"And\" you'll need to match\nall\nof the filter groups, if it's an \"Or\" you'll only need to match\none\nof the filter groups.\nLook at the first filter group. Let's say you match the first criteria. If it's an \"Or\", then you already match this grouping without needing to check the other filters. If it's an \"And\" you'll need to match the rest of the filters in this grouping.\nProgress through each of the filter groups and see at which point you'd match them (or not).\nNegative filters (\"Is Not\"/\"Does Not Contain\")\nYou'll almost always want to combine negative filters (\"is not\" or \"does not contain\") with an \"And\" (not an \"Or\"). There are exceptions of course, but you'll need to go through your logic carefully to ensure the right result. The rules must be treated as separate checks in this case.\nFor example, if you use \"Or\" for these rules below, it will match\neveryone\n.\n\u200b\n1. Plan is not Pro\nOR\n2. Plan is not Premium\nIf a user has the Pro plan, they will not match the first rule, however, they will match the second rule, as Pro is not Premium. Therefore, you need to use \"And\" here.\nURL filters\nThere are a few things to consider when targeting page URLs in filters (useful for in-app message targeting and Messenger visibility settings).\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The first is the same as the above \u261d trying to combine multiple negative filters (\"page URL is not\", \"page URL does not contain\") should often use \"And\".\nFor example, \"Current page URL is not\nhttps://example.com/pricing\nor\nCurrent page URL is not\nhttps://example.com/login\n\" will always be true, even if the user is on\n/pricing\nor\n/login\nat the time, because they don't match the\nother\none. This should be an 'And' combination.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The second is using\nReferral URL\ninstead of\nCurrent page URL\n. A\nReferral URL\nfilter looks at the page a user was on\nbefore\nthey arrived to the current website, not the current page they're on. This is typically used for marketing purposes, to capture where leads are being referred to a website from.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The third is not including the\nfull URL\n(including\nhttps://\nand any trailing\n/\nparts) with an exact match (\"URL is\", \"URL is not\") filter. Those exact match filters require the entire source URL, including the\nhttps://\npart (which means if a customer is on\nhttp://\nthey won't match for it).\nA safer way to target URLs is to use \"URL contains\", which doesn't require the full URL to work. For example,\nURL contains example.com/pricing\ninstead of\nURL is https://example.com/pricing\n.\nFuture Dates\nWhen targeting dates in the future, you need to use a\nnegative number\n, and if you're trying to do a \"more than\"/\"less than\" date range, include a \"less than 0 days\" filter to cap the range.\nLearn more about creating filters for dates in the future\n.\nPowerful ways to combine filters\nUsers on specific platforms -\nYou could filter for anyone who uses your iOS or Android app, who has also never used your web app. This allows you to promote cross-platform usage of your app.\nUsers who have completed a combination of events\n- There might be a few different groups of users who could benefit from a new release. With this combination you can find all the people in those groups, who haven\u2019t yet tried your new feature.\nUsers in multiple specific locations\n- This can be helpful for billing announcements that only affect a certain region.

This article covers how to use filters with your standard and custom attributes.\nThere are four types of attribute. Each has different filters:\nText:\n\u2018Starts with\u2019, \u2018Ends with\u2019, \u2018Contains\u2019, 'Contains exact word', \u2018Is\u2019, \u2018Is not\u2019, \u2018Is unknown\u2019, \u2018Has any value\u2019.\nNumber/Decimal Number:\n\u2018Greater than\u2019, \u2018Less than\u2019, \u2018Is\u2019, \u2018Is not\u2019, \u2018Is unknown\u2019, \u2018Has any value\u2019.\nTrue or False (Boolean):\n\u2018True\u2019, \u2018False\u2019, \u2018Is Unknown\u2019, \u2018Has any value\u2019.\nDate:\n\u2018More than\u2019, \u2018Less than\u2019, \u2018Exactly\u2019, \u2018After\u2019, \u2018On\u2019, \u2018Before\u2019, \u2018Is unknown\u2019, \u2018Has any value\u2019.\nImportant:\n'Is' and 'Is not' filters are case sensitive. A filter like 'Name\nis\n\"john doe\"' will not match a user with the name 'John Doe'. 'Name\ncontains\n\"john doe\"' will match.\n\"Contains\" can match the keyword if it's part of a larger word (i.e. \"Contains\npost\n\" will match for the words\nposted\nand\nposter\nand\nposting\n), whereas \"Contains exact word\" would require that the word\npost\nis standalone.\nFor numbers, we don't have a greater than or equal to number so instead you will need to use the greater than filter. For example if you need to filter \"greater than or equal to 3\" then you would use the filter, \"greater than 2\".\nStandard attribute filters\nYou can filter your customers based on their activity with these standard attributes:\nLast contacted at\n- The time they were last contacted by you, with an auto/manual message, or with a reply in a conversation.\nLast heard from at\n- The time they last contacted you, either directly or in reply to a message.\nLast seen\n- The time they were last tracked by Intercom in your app or on your site.\nYou can also filter for those customers who can receive email messages:\nUnsubscribed from emails\n- If this is \u201cTrue\u201d these people will not receive any auto-message emails or manual message emails sent to a large audience.\nHas hard bounced\n- This will be \u201cTrue\u201d for any person that you\u2019ve tried to email where that email bounced back to Intercom. We\u2019ll no longer attempt to send any emails to this address.\nMarked email as spam\n- \u201cTrue\u201d for anyone who marks one of your emails as spam. We\u2019ll no longer attempt to send any emails to this address.\nIntercom applies these filters to your message audiences automatically, which can lead to lower numbers than expected.\nLooking to send a campaign to all brand new users? Just add a filter in the entry criteria for \u201cSigned up after [Today\u2019s date]\u201d. This will exclude all your existing users, and start sending to your new ones from tomorrow.\nTo filter your customers by country, use the full name of the country like this:\nClick here for the\nfull list of the ISO 3166 country names\navailable.\nDate filters\nEach \u201cday\u201d in Intercom\u2019s filters represents a 24 hour period\n, beginning at the current moment. This means that a filter for \u201csigned up exactly 0 days ago\u201d would match any user who signed up less than 24 hours ago. If they signed up between 24 and 48 hours ago, that\u2019s \u201c1 day ago\u201d.\nIf you want to create filters for dates in the future\n, you need to use negative numbers. For example, if you want to send an auto message to customers 3 days before their subscription ends, first create a \"subscription_ends_at\" custom attribute and filter for \"more than -3 days ago\":\nThen, to ensure it doesn\u2019t send to anyone whose subscription has already ended, add a filter for \"less than 0 days ago.\"\nImportant: Filters for \u201cless than X days ago\u201d will also apply to \u00a0dates in the future.\nIf you\u2019re filtering on an attribute that can be a past\nor future\ndate, add a filter for \u201cMore than 0 days ago\u201d to only target those in the past.\nCompany filters\nIf a person is a member of multiple companies in your workspace, only one of their companies needs to match a filter for them to be returned. For example, if you create a filter for \u201ccompany plan is Premium\u201d this will match any customer where at least one of their companies is on your premium plan, even if their other companies are not.\nTo filter for users that aren't in a company, create a\nsegment\nwith a filter for \u201ccompany name has any value\u201d, then filter for all customers who aren\u2019t in that segment.\nMobile filters\nTo identify users of your mobile app/s, you can filter for those with iOS or Android sessions\nYou can then filter further with more specific filters for each platform like \u201cLast seen on iOS\u201d and whether or not they\u2019re identified users.\nTo filter for customers who can receive push messages, use the standard attribute \u201cEnabled Push Messaging\u201d.\nTo identify people using a certain mobile operating system, you can filter for:\nOS contains Android\nOS contains iOS\nOS contains Windows\nOS filters will include people who have visited your website or web app from their\nmobile browser\n. iOS/Android session filters will only include sessions from your\nmobile app\n, where you have Intercom installed with one of our SDKs.\nThis may not include users on every mobile device, but will cover the majority.\nCombining 'And' filters with 'Or' filters\nTo target a more nuanced set of users or leads, you can combine 'and' with 'or' to create more flexible rules. For example, you could target users on one of two plans, who signed up less than 60 days ago.\nJust add the first filter, then click '\n+\nAdd filter':\nAfter you add your second 'And' filter, click the '\n+\n' to create a filter group, and add your second OS filter:\nFinally, set the filter group to use 'Or' logic:\nNow, your filters match all users who are either on iOS\nor\nAndroid.\nLearn more about using And / Or filters\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCheck up on your customers regularly\nHow to segment your contacts\nSegment out your active users for messaging\nCreate more targeted audiences with And / Or rules\nHow do I filter an outbound message audience from a CSV file?"},

For example, you could create a segment of trial users and send them onboarding messages, or you could create a segment of hot prospects, loyal customers or whatever you like.\nWhat is a segment?\nA segment is a group of your users defined by rules (or filters) that you set. Users are automatically added to the segment every time the user updates to match those rules.\nWe recommend creating a segment for every key group of users you'd like to send a message to - for example, trial users or users who have yet to take action.\nCreate a segment\nTo create a new segment, go to your\nContacts\n.\nClick\n+ Add filter\nand select the people or company data you want to filter by.\nFor example, if you want to create a segment of inactive users who haven't logged in within the past 30 days,  just filter for \"last seen more than 30 days ago.\"\nCombine filters using\nAnd / Or rules\nfor very specific targeting.\nThen click\nSave segment\nand give your segment a name (something easy to remember, like \"Inactive Users\"). Your new segment will appear on the left under Contacts.\nSend targeted auto messages\nFrom here you can message these users by clicking\nNew message\non top of the user list, and selecting a message type (i.e. email, post, survey, etc.)\nOne of the most powerful features of Intercom is the ability to create targeted ongoing messages to a\nDynamic Audience\nbased on your filters and segments.\u00a0Once you put your ongoing message live, these customers and every customer who subsequently meets these criteria will get the message (just once).\nPredefined segments\nIntercom comes with three predefined segments, and you\u2019ll see these at the top of your user list:\nActive:\nAnyone who has been active in the last 30 days (this is the most relevant segment as it really informs you as to who is actually using your product).\nNew:\nAnyone who has signed up in the last 24 hours.\nUseful segments to create\nThe segments you create should be specific to your product. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nPro plan customers\n- These are your highest paying users or those on your most expensive plan. You should prioritize this group and ensure they receive your best possible service.\nTrial users\n- These are the people you need to make sure convert. You\u2019ll want to give them a warm welcome and show them how to make the most of your features. Your filters for this segment might be something like: \u2018Signed up less than 14 days ago\u2019 and \u2018Plan is free trial.'\nHot prospects\n- These are prospects who are active and are approaching a barrier. For example, if you\u2019re a photo sharing app you can create a segment for everyone who has more than 80 photos uploaded of a possible 100 allowed. Your filters for this segment might be something like: \u2018Plan is starter\u2019 and \u2018Uploaded photos more than 80.'\nLoyal customers\n- You might want to create a list of loyal users for beta testing your new features. Or maybe you want to reward these users with a thank you gift. Your filters here might be: \u2018Signed up more than 365 days ago AND last seen less than 30 days ago.'\nNo action taken\n- You could create a segment of users who have yet to download your mobile app. Then you can give them a little nudge and remind them how to download it and why they should. Your filters here might be: \u2018Downloaded mobile app is false.'\nCreate flexible segments with And / Or filters\nTo create more sophisticated segments you can\ncombine \"And\" with \"Or\" filters\n. This makes segments more powerful and flexible.\nFor example, if you\u2019re holding events, you could filter for all paid users in specific countries you're hosting the events:\nHighly complex segment queries may take longer to run and in some cases, be too complex. If this is the case you'll receive a notification to simplify the filters.\nSearch for segments\nTo see who belongs to a segment, just select this segment from the menu under\nContacts\n.\nOr filter the\nContacts\nlist by \"Segment\" to show users that belong to a certain segment.\nHow to edit or delete a segment\nTo edit a segment, select this segment from the menu under\nContacts\n. The filters for that segment will appear above the list of users, and you can edit them from there.\nTo edit the name of your Segment, navigate to\nSettings > Data > People > Segments\nand click on the pencil icon. \ud83d\udc47\nYou can also delete a segment from\nSettings > Data > People > Segments\n. Select the red\nx icon\nnext to the segment you\u2019d like to delete.\nYou need to be an admin with full\npermissions\nto edit and delete segments.\nHow to show and hide a segment\nSegments are available to everybody, but the visibility of these on the Contacts menu is based on personal teammate settings.\nTo make a new segment visible, each teammate will need to go to\nContacts\nand click on the + button:\nFrom here, teammates may toggle the visibility of each segment by clicking the show/hide buttons:\n\u200b\nTeammates can also click the \"manage segments\" option and click the \"Make visible\" or \"Make hidden\" buttons:\nSegment users not part of any companies\nApplying a\nCompany ID is unknown\nfilter to your user list will not filter out users that don't belong to any one company.\nInstead, this filter will return all users who are attached to companies but where these companies have an ID value of\nnull\n.\nThe same logic is used in other filters like these, such as\nCompany name is unknown.\nTo filter out users that don't belong to a company, you will have to create 2 segments;\nA segment where users are filtered by\nCompany ID has any value\n- let's call this\nSegment1\nA segment where\nSegment is NOT Segment1\nSegment results for users part of multiple companies\nIf you are using a company attribute to create a filter or segment, users belonging to multiple companies will match for the segment if any one of their companies has a matching attribute.\nThis may lead to confusion as we will only show one company in the list and they may show a different attribute than you're expecting on the column.\n50,000 Company's Match Error\nIf you receive this error: \"Your filters include company data, and more than 50,000 companies match\", the query is too large for us to accurately show the preview however if using the filters in a\nProactive Support\nmessage, it will still send to the full audience.\n\u200b\nIf you have less than 50,000 Company's and are receiving this error, it is because you have archived Company's that still contribute to this number. In this case, you can bypass the search limit here by adding the rule  \"People is greater than 0\" as a filter.

It shows you a list of all your Users who have been\nLast seen\nwithin the past 30 days.\nFrom here you can click into any of the other default segments - All Users, All Leads, Active, and New - as well as any custom segments you might have created for your workspace.\nNote:\nIf you want to see a list of your Leads or Users, just click on the\nAll Leads\nor\nAll Users\ntab at the top of your People list.\nNote:\nTo optimize performance we only search with custom data for the\nfirst\nmatching company for the list of Users. So if a User is returned in the search that belongs to multiple companies, it's possible you won't be able to see custom data for other Users' companies.\nLet's look more closely at the key features of the People list.\n1. Filters\nUsing the\n+ Add filter\nbutton, located at the top of any People list, you can apply various filters to drill down into your user base to answer specific questions. A default Intercom install will include a number of standard People and Company attributes which will generate lots of useful data to filter on.\nBut you can also send Intercom any data that might help you better answer questions of your user base. There are two types of data that you can send through for People contacts:\nCustom User Attributes\nand\nUser Events\n. They'll appear here in your filter bar alongside the standard user attributes.\nHere's a detailed explanation on how filters work\n.\n2. Segments\nIn the left-hand column of the\nContacts\npage, at the top of the\nPeople\nsection you\u2019ll see your segments. There are 2 default segments available here when you first install Intercom:\nNew\n- anyone who signed up in the last day.\nActive\n- anyone who has logged in at least once in the last month.\nYou can of course create whatever segments you want, based on any combination of criteria you like, and they'll display here within your People list.\n3. Bulk actions\nAbove the columns of any People list you'll find the buttons to trigger bulk actions. Here (depending on what Intercom product you have) you can message, tag, delete, or export any selected list of People.\n4. Data columns\nTo the right of your list you'll see the data columns that have been selected to be displayed. These show the value for each attribute within a Lead, User, or Company profile. You can customize what columns you want to show by selecting them within the displayed user attributes dropdown menu accessed via the button at the top right above the data lists columns.\n5. Search\nAt the top of the left column, next to\nContacts\n, is the '\ud83d\udd0d' search button to search your People contacts by user name, email address or by tag (details on how to bulk tag People\nhere\n).\n6. Send Proactive support messages\nYou can easily create and send\nProactive support\ncontent (depending on your Intercom subscription package) to a list of People based on the conditions you set in the\nfilter bar\n.

Intercom automatically tracks the five standard UTM parameters, so you can:\nSee where your most engaged users are signing up to your product from.\nIncrease signups from your advertising campaigns.\nSend targeted auto messages to users who sign up from specific sources (e.g. Google ads).\nMeasure the ROI of your advertising campaigns by comparing a campaign's generated revenue with its cost.\nAutomatically send your leads' source to\nSalesforce\n.\nIntercom only stores a Lead/Users most recent UTM data. If they engage with more than one advertising campaign, Intercom will only show UTM data for the most recent campaign. Past UTM data is retained.\nWhat are UTM parameters?\nYour\nUTM parameters\nare pieces of information within a URL which identify the website a lead came from, what type of channel they signed up on (medium), and what advertising campaign they were associated with. These are the UTM parameters:\nutm_campaign\nutm_source\nutm_medium\nutm_term\nutm_content\nWhen you set up the UTM parameters for an advertising campaign, your URL will have extra characters attached to the end, like this:\nSee your customers' UTM data in Intercom\nWhen you use UTM parameters in your campaigns, you'll be able to see which leads and users engaged with them by filtering by UTM data in your\nContacts\n:\nBest practices for using UTM data in Intercom\nOnce you\u2019ve set up your UTM parameters in Intercom, you can see where your new signups are coming from and send them targeted messages. Here\u2019s how \ud83d\udc47\nSee where your most engaged users are signing up from\nIt\u2019s easy to spot trends in how specific groups of users are signing up to your product. For example, your most engaged users could be coming from a specific source, like a Google Search ad. In Intercom, just filter your users by your UTM parameters (in this example, utm_source=google).\nYou can also see where your least engaged users are coming from, and investigate why they aren\u2019t engaging with your product.\nSend targeted messages to new signups\nDid you just run a successful ad campaign? You can identify the signups from that campaign within Intercom and send them tailored\nmessages\n.\nOr, you could run an ad campaign promoting an ebook to two distinct groups of users (e.g. marketers and product managers). If you use UTM parameters to pass through audience information, you can filter the audience that downloaded your book into two distinct groups - in this case marketers and product managers. Then, you can create highly relevant\nSeries\ntailored to each group.\nFor example, you could enter everyone who signed up via a specific Google ad into a\nSeries\nin Intercom. Then, create a series of messages that are consistent with the messaging on the page they converted from. So if you were pitching a certain feature in your Google ad, the messaging in your\nSeries\nwould reinforce it.\nWith more visibility on your users\u2019 touch points, you\u2019ll write\nbetter messages\nthat are tailored to their experience.\nIncrease conversions on your advertising campaigns\nWith UTM parameters in Intercom, you\u2019ll gain a clear picture of how your advertising campaigns are performing. Simply filter your leads or users by campaign, source, or any other parameters you\u2019re using, to see how engaged users are with your product.\nFor example, imagine you\u2019re running an advertising campaign that isn\u2019t performing. But you can see in Intercom that users from that campaign are highly likely to\nuse\nyour product and become paying customers. With this data, you\u2019ll make better decisions on which campaigns are working best, and not just rely on initial volumes and ad clicks.\nMeasure the ROI on your advertising campaigns\nIf you measure the revenue created by customers from a specific campaign, against the cost of that campaign, you can measure the overall ROI of your campaign. You should also compare the revenue from multiple advertising campaigns, to see which ones won the most customers, at the most efficient rate.\nAutomatically send your leads' UTM data to Salesforce\nIf you use our\nSalesforce integration\n, you easily can map your UTM parameters to fields in Salesforce. For example, you can map your 'UTM source' to the 'Source' field in Salesforce. Your leads' source will then update automatically in Salesforce when they get attributed a source in Intercom. Your sales teammates will then be able to see the most recent source your leads came from, so they have more context on how to best nurture them.\nWhen you insert the follow-up action \u2018Create lead in Salesforce\u2019, you can specify a custom lead source. This allows you to track where your leads are being captured so that you can use this attribute in defining your audience. You can use this to opt prospects into marketing campaigns that are suited to their needs, segment your audience for reports.\nWrite better help content using search data\nIf you send Google Search keyword data to Intercom via UTM parameters, you can even see what keywords new signups are searching for when they visit your website. For example, you could find that many of your users are finding your website by searching \u00a0for certain questions. You can use this information to\nwrite relevant help articles\nthat address your users\u2019 questions.\nUse UTM parameters for link clicks in Proactive support messages\nYou can also use UTM parameters to track which links your users are clicking in emails.\nMany customers use the\nutm_content\ntag for this. For example, you might append\n&utm_content=button\nto your button link,\n&utm_content=header\nto your header image link, etc.\nYou'll be able to see which links users have clicked from the message 'Clicked' stats, and the parameters will also be stored on each user's profile for any future message targeting or reporting.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCreate and track custom data attributes (CDAs)\nGet started with Contacts\nRecord customer activity with event tracking\nInstall Salesforce integration\nCustomize the Inbox with apps"},

If you use a service like Zapier, and come across any issues, you should reach out to their support team directly.\nOne thing to note about methods CSV and REST API\n: When users log in, the data sent from your integration to Intercom will overwrite the values you've set with API/CSV import.

This means you\u2019ll have both a lead and user profile for the same person.\nLearn more about how leads and users work in Intercom\n.\nWhen this happens, you can merge the lead profile with the user profile, so all of their information is tracked and stored in one place.\nMerging lead and user profiles\nA lead can be merged into an existing user\u2019s account either manually, automatically or via the REST API. Merging a lead into a user means that any information associated with the lead will be transferred over to the user profile.\nThere are certain types of profiles you can (and can\u2019t) merge:\nA lead can be merged into a user profile.\n2 leads cannot be merged.\n2 users cannot be merged.\nA user profile cannot be merged back into a lead profile.\nHere\u2019s how to merge two profiles:\nManually merge profiles\nThere are two ways to trigger a manual merge. \u270c\ufe0f\nFirst, by changing the email address of a lead, to match the email address of an existing user. This can be done from the lead's profile:\nThen, the next time the user visits your website (or refreshes the page, if they're already online) they will be merged with the newly updated lead.\nIf there are two or more users with that email, the user who was most recently active will be merged with the lead.\nSecondly, by importing the lead with a CSV import.\nThe lead will need to have the same email address as that of an existing user in order for a merge to happen. Also, if a lead already exists in Intercom, importing a CSV will not merge the existing lead into a user. A lead imported from a CSV will only merge into a user if it is a brand new lead.\nRead more about importing leads and users via CSV\n.\nManually merge potential duplicates from the Inbox\nThe potential duplicates feature will warn you via the Inbox if there are any duplicate leads or users for the person you\u2019re currently speaking with.

This will refresh the conversation in the inbox with the details of the newly merged user, so you can see previous conversations etc. Check out how this works\nhere\n.\nAutomatically merge profiles based on cookie\nAutomatic merges require no action on your part. When a person visits your website in a logged-out state, they\u2019re given an\nIntercom cookie\nto uniquely identify them. Once they start a conversation or reply to a message, they become a lead.\nIf they log in or sign up to your product while the Intercom cookie is present, their lead profile will be automatically merged with their user profile.\nAutomatically merge profiles based on email address only\nYou can enable \"Merging of unverified Leads into Users\" in your\nSecurity Settings\n.

Leads and users won't be required to share the same device, cookie or session for a merge to go ahead.\nIf you wish to enable this, you must\nenable Identity Verification\nbeforehand as this ensures your user requests come from the users they claim to be.\nAny automatic merges will take place the next time the\nUser\nlogs into Intercom.\nMerge profiles using the API\nYou can also use the REST API to\nconvert a lead to user\n.\nCommon questions about merging profiles\nWhat data is included in the merge?\nAttributes\nfrom the lead profile (only if the existing user profile contains no value for those attributes)\nConversations (all conversations associated with the lead and user profile will be included)\nEvents (the first/last occurred and the event count; no metadata is included)\nWhy didn\u2019t a lead merge?\nMost of the time, lead and user profiles merge immediately. But since it's an asynchronous process, small delays can occur. For example, when a user logs in and there are one or more leads marked as requiring merging (based on cookie and email), the automatic merging process will begin on that user's next ping (page refresh).\nFor leads created via our REST API:\nIf you create a lead via the API, and then a user with the same email address who didn't previously exist sends in a ping (by logging into your app), the lead and user profiles will not be merged automatically. We only do asynchronous merging when the Lead and User have the same anonymous_id which is taken from the session cookie. Leads created via the API do not have cookies. Instead you can\nmanually merge via the API\n.\nIf you create a lead via the API and a user with the same email address already exists, then when that existing user sends in a ping (by logging into your app), the lead and user records will not merge automatically.\nIf you create a lead via the API, then create a user via the API, the lead profile won\u2019t be merged automatically into the user profile when this user sends in a ping (by logging into your app).\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHow do visitors, leads and users work in Intercom?\nAssign an owner to your leads and users\nHubSpot app\nCreate new Leads and Users in Intercom\nGroup your leads by Qualification Company"},

You can see all the pages they visit, or greet them with a personalized message.\nWhy do I have duplicate leads?\nIf a lead emails your app with the email address of an existing verified lead, we'll only associate the conversation with a verified lead. If there's no verified lead with that email address, we'll create a new lead instead.\nA lead becomes verified when:\nThey originate from an inbound email.\nOr they were uploaded from a CSV.\nNote:\nA lead won't be verified if they got in touch via the Messenger or their email address is edited by an admin in the UI.\nWhy do leads have random names?\nWhen a logged out visitor starts a conversation with you, we don't have information about their real name, and sometimes they choose not to leave their email address either. Creating a random name, such as\nBlue Cloud from New York\n, helps to think of your leads in a more personal way. When someone provides their email address, we'll use it to replace the random name.\nYou can also update their name manually from the Inbox sidebar, or add it as\nqualification data\nto be collected in the Messenger. You can use\nBasics\nor\nWorkflows\n(if it's part of your subscription) to collect this data.\nOutside of the Inbox, you can update a lead's name using a\nCSV import\nor\nour API\n(using the lead's unique identifier to match the update to the correct lead).\nWhen does a lead become a user?\nA lead becomes a user when they sign up to your product, or log into an existing account. All of the information and conversations you've had with them remain in their user profile.\nNote:\nWe only automatically\nmerge leads into users\nwhen they share the same device cookie.\nCan I track leads in my mobile app?\nNo, but if you install Intercom in your mobile app with our\nAndroid or iOS SDKs\n, you can track unidentified users. If you don't \u00a0identify them in Intercom with a name or email address, you'll see an automatically generated name with the format: 'User qwv0'.\nHow do I get a visitor\u2019s email address?\nWhen a visitor or lead starts a conversation, they\u2019re\nautomatically prompted to enter their email address\nin case they leave before they get an answer. If they don't leave their email, they\u2019ll need to come back to your website to receive your answer.\nImportant:\nIf a visitor or lead leaves their email address, you can\nedit it\nat any time.\nIf a visitor or lead doesn\u2019t leave their email address they\u2019ll have to come back to your website to receive your answer.\nIf you get your visitor or lead's email address while chatting, you can manually\nadd it to their profile\n.\nCan I track events and custom data for leads?\nYes. However,\nevents\nand\ncustom data\nare only recorded when a visitor initiates a conversation and becomes a lead.\nCan I track sessions for visits/page views for leads?\nWe don't track sessions, because many onboarding messaging workflows are based on the number of sessions a user has with your product. You can, however,\ntrack page views using event metadata\n.\nNote:\nIt\u2019s not currently possible to filter leads based on specific event metadata.\nCan I add leads to companies?\nYes, it is possible to add leads to a company via\nthe REST API\n.\nCan I import leads via a CSV?\nYes.\nHere\u2019s how\n.\nCan I delete leads?\nYes, every now and then you may want to clean the list of people you're tracking - especially leads you haven't interacted with in a long time.\nHere\u2019s how.\nAre leads supported in Intercom's APIs?\nYes. There is basic support for things like\ncreating leads\n,\nconverting leads into users\n, and\nupdating leads\n. You can also contact users using the conversations endpoint in the REST API.\nDo Intercom's integrations support leads?\nYes, you can easily manage your leads workflow with our two-way\nSalesforce integration\n.\nZapier\nalso provides limited support for leads.\nHow do I clear a user\u2019s session with the Intercom shutdown method?\nIf you use the Inbox combined with another product (like Outbound), any user who shares a computer and browser will be able to see the most recently active Lead or Users\u2019s conversation history until the cookie expires. You\nshould call the Intercom shutdown method\nto clear your users\u2019 conversations anytime they logout of your application.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall Intercom for visitors and leads on web\nInstall Intercom for users on web\nGenerating leads with Intercom\nMerge lead and user profiles\nCreate new Leads and Users in Intercom"},

We store three types of data about your users:\nStandard data attributes\n- a default set of data we already have about your users.\nCustom data attributes\n- data you send us about your users.\nEvents\n- data that records specific actions users take in your app.\nBelow, we\u2019ll explain how these data types work and how you can make the most of them.\nStandard data attributes\nYou\u2019ll find a list of standard user attributes under the\nDetails\nsection of every contact (user or lead).\nYou can expand and edit this list to show the user data that's important to you, such as the date they signed up, how many web sessions they've had, or their browser language etc.\nTip:\nStandard data attributes are case sensitive, see the exact\nsyntax\nyou should use when sending this data into Intercom.\nNote:\nIf you've installed Intercom on your mobile app, you'll also see standard user attributes like: 'Last seen on iOS/Android', 'iOS/Android sessions' and 'iOS/Android device', etc.\nFiltering standard user attributes\nNow, armed with this data you can quickly filter your user base to answer questions, such as:\nWho signed up in the last week?\nWho signed up once but never returned?\nWhat users on the free plan are yet to upgrade?\nWho was using regularly up until a month ago, and then quit?\nYou can combine as many complex filters as you like and send targeted\nongoing messages\nbased on these filters. For example, if you want to encourage new users to upload their first song, you could send a message to users who \u2018Signed up less than 30 days ago.\u2019\nNote:\nStandard data attributes automatically get updated. For example if a new user signs up, or logs in today that will get updated automatically in the list.\nCustom data attributes\nIntercom lets you\nsend custom attributes about your users\nand these will all show in your user list too. Custom data attributes are information you send us about your users, like how many times they've purchased an item from your store, how many projects they have, or what plan they're on. For example, if you have a music sharing app, you could send us over the number of songs a user has played, or how many followers they have.\nYou can send us over whatever attributes you want to better understand your customers, and it will all show in Intercom. You\u2019ll find lots\nmore examples here\n.\nYou can create custom attributes about your users and/or about the\ncompanies\nthey belong to.\nYou cannot create custom attributes with the same name as a standard attribute.\nFiltering custom data attributes\nYou can apply filters based on custom data attributes, the same way you would with standard data attributes.\nOnce you\u2019ve applied your filters, you can send these users and visitors targeted\nongoing messages\n.\nTip:\nYou can also use custom data attributes as\nqualification data.\nEvents\nYou can\nsend events\nto Intercom, to record whenever users take specific actions in your product. Events record the first and last time a user does something and the total amount of times they do something. For example, you can see the first time users clicked on a particular page, or when they most recently purchased an item.\nEvents will show in your user list, and you can filter them to answer questions like:\nAre users visiting the same product page a lot recently?\nHave they used the export feature a bunch of times? or\nHave they downgraded their plan?\nDirect user profile links\nWith the user_id or email address of your user you can link directly to their user profile in Intercom using the following URLs:\nhttps://app.intercom.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/users/show?user_id=THE_USER_ID\nhttps://app.intercom.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/users/show?email=THE_USER_EMAIL\nNote\n: The second URL above will only work for unique email addresses - these are email addresses that exist once in your user list.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSegment\nimportant groups of users into specific groups.\nQuickly and easily\nexport\nyour user data out of Intercom.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nImport your user data into Intercom\nCreate and track custom data attributes (CDAs)\nCustomize Intercom to be about your users\nThe Intercom Glossary\nHow Intercom tracks and stores data"},

This way you\u2019ll get the insight that truly matters - specific to\nyour\nproduct. There are two kinds of data you can send;\ncustom user attributes\n, and\nevents\n.

Turning on the bot inbox allows you to\nautomatically assign conversations to a separate bot inbox\nwhile a workflow or Fin AI Agent is active.\nThis means conversations aren't being 'double handled' and your team can focus on conversations that need a human touch. This also lets you exclude bot time from your SLA timers and inbox reports.\nTurn on the bot inbox\nTo enable the bot inbox, go to\nSettings > AI & Automation > Automation\nand open\nTurn on the bot inbox\nto toggle this on.\nThe bot inbox will now appear in your list of\nTeammates\ninboxes. If you've\ncustomized your bot's identity to match your brand\n, the inbox will show your bot icon and name.\nYou can see conversations currently being handled by Fin AI Agent or Workflows in this inbox or in the\nAll\ninbox.\n\u200b\nNote:\nTurning on the bot inbox\nassigns\nconversations where Fin is active to the dedicated bot inbox, which means these conversations aren't in any teammate inboxes (until they are reassigned to them i.e. because a customer asked to talk to support).\nThis is different to the\nFin AI Agent inbox view\nwhich allows you to see all conversations where Fin was involved, regardless of who they were assigned to.\nYou cannot manually assign conversations to the bot inbox.\nAll assignments from background workflows are deferred until the conversation is moved out of bot inbox, or the matching customer-facing workflow has finished.\nExclude bot time from your SLAs\nWhen enabling the bot inbox you can also check the box \"Exclude the time conversations spend in the bot inbox from SLA targets\". This means the SLA timer will only begin once a conversation is assigned out of the inbox:\nFor example:\nIf you have an SLA of 5 minutes, and leave this setting\nunchecked:\nIf a conversation spends 3 minutes in the bot inbox, your team will have 2 minutes to respond within the SLA.\nWith an SLA of 5 minutes and this setting\nchecked:\nIf a conversation spends 3 minutes in the bot inbox your team will still have 5 minutes from the time when it is assigned out of the bot inbox.\nHow it works with assignment rules and reports\nAssignment rules\nWith the dedicated bot inbox enabled,\ninbound\nconversations with bots will be assigned there first, and\nyour assignment rules\nwill run\nafter\nthe customer has finished the bot path, or told Fin AI Agent they\u2019d like to wait for the team.\u00a0If the conversation doesn\u2019t match any of your rules, it will be assigned to your\ndefault\nassignee, which you can select at the bottom of the rules list.\nImportant:\nWhen the dedicated bot inbox is enabled, the bot will be set as the assignee of the conversation before any rules get matched. If you have any rules with a condition of 'Teammate assignee is None', you will need to add another condition like 'or Teammate assignee is [bot name]' to ensure the rule will match.\nTo run assignment rules on a conversation started from an\noutbound\nmessage or workflow, create a rule based on the trigger: 'when a customer replies to outbound content'.\nOtherwise, conversations where a customer replies to an\noutbound\nmessage or bot will be assigned to the bot inbox first, and moved to the 'Unassigned' inbox\nafter\nthe customer has finished the bot path, or told Fin AI Agent they\u2019d like to wait for the team.\nIf there are any mid-path assignment rules in your Workflows, they\u2019ll take effect immediately, and route the conversation out of the bot inbox.\nAll assignments from background workflows are deferred until the conversation is moved out of bot inbox, or the matching customer-facing workflow has finished. Any deferred assignments from background workflows are then applied after the matching customer-facing workflow finishes but only if no other assignment was applied.\nAfter 15 minutes of inactivity from the customer, if no auto-close rules are implemented, the conversation will leave the bot inbox and follow your assignment rules.\nInbox reports\nWith the dedicated bot inbox enabled, the\nTime to close\nand\nFirst response time\nmetrics in your Inbox reports will have a new filter you can apply to include or exclude the time bots spend handling a conversation.\nWith the bot inbox enabled, you\u2019ll see a new filter on the following Inbox reports:\nOverview\nInbox summary > Conversations\nPerformance > Responsiveness\nPerformance > Team performance\nLeads\nAnd in Custom reports you create under\nMetric\nIt\u2019s only possible to exclude bot inbox time from your reports for the period since you enabled the bot inbox.\nTurning off the dedicated bot inbox\nIf you decide you no longer want the bot inbox on, you can switch it off at any time.\nFin AI Agent conversations will be assigned out of the bot inbox automatically after 3 minutes of inactivity, however if you want to reassign them sooner, you can.\nWorkflows conversations will need to be manually reassigned to another inbox.\nEven with the bot inbox turned off, you'll still be able to keep an eye on conversations where Fin was involved using the\nFin AI Agent inbox view\n.

If a user rates the conversation but leaves the conversation open and comes back after the time period set, it appears to them that they can change the rating the rating however this change will not be recorded on our end as the timeframe has passed.\nThis setting acts as a fallback if you haven't configured it through\nWorkflows\n.\nHow conversation rating (CSAT) surveys are sent\nWhen a teammate closes a conversation with a customer, the simple automation is signaled to send a conversation rating. The automation sends conversation ratings for both in-app messages and emails. The rating is applied to the teammate who last sent a message or email in the conversation.\nHere\u2019s how ratings look in the Messenger \ud83d\udc47\nAnd here\u2019s how they look in email \ud83d\udc47\nWhen customers click on a reaction, they\u2019ll be requested to give additional feedback.\nCustomers\ncan't change\ntheir rating after they've left one with a comment.\nAdding Messenger apps to closed conversations\nA teammate can send a Messenger application to close out their conversations and send a CSAT survey, instead of the standard Intercom Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) app.\nYou can enable this by:\nNavigating to the\nFin AI Agent > Simple automations > For User / For Lead\n.\nTurning on the\nAsk for conversation rating\nautomation.\nSelecting\nAdd an app\n.\nChoosing an app from the list of installed apps\nor\nexploring the Intercom App store to install and add a new app.\nThis feature only works with Messenger apps. It is not available for Inbox apps.\nIf a custom/third-party CSAT app is inserted only it will appear when a conversation is closed - the Intercom CSAT app will not appear.\nWhen do simple automations send conversation ratings?\nA simple automation only sends conversation ratings at the right time. A rating appears when a conversation matches the following criteria:\nThe conversation was replied to by a teammate\nOR\na teammate starts a direct outbound conversation\nOR\nthe conversation was started from a Workflow where a teammate also participated.\nThe conversation is over 250 characters (including spaces, and replies from your teammate and customer). This helps ensure ratings don\u2019t send for short conversations with a simply yes/no answer.\nThe conversation is closed within a week of the last reply. If you or the customer hasn\u2019t replied to the conversation in seven days, we won\u2019t send a conversation rating, to prevent them from appearing on old conversations.\nIt's not a group conversation. A simple automation will not send a rating request when more than one user/lead are included in the conversation.\nProvided other criteria is met, a CSAT request will be sent any time it is included in a workflow. However, Teammates will still only be able to receive one rating per conversation. If multiple requests are sent for the same teammate in a conversation, these will all appear but are effectively a single request/rating. They will all update together if a rating is received.\nWhen do Workflows send conversation ratings?\nIt's not a group conversation. Your workflow will not send a rating request when more than one user/lead are included in the conversation.\nConversation must have at least one message from a valid agent. This means that the conversation must have at least one message sent by the Workflow, Fin or a teammate.\nIf teammate created an outbound conversation either manually or via the workflow but never sent anything after that initial part, we would not send CSAT in this case.\nIf conversation was sent via the workflow and did not get any reply from the end user, CSAT still going to trigger.\nSee how your team performs with customer satisfaction\nTo see how people feel at the end of their conversations with your team, just\ncreate a customer satisfaction report\nand take a look at your\nTeammate\nCSAT score\n.\nNote:\nYou can also see the conversation ratings each of your teammates received over a specific time period.\nBest practices for conversation ratings\nTurn your dissatisfied customers into happy ones\nConversation ratings help you better understand your customer\u2019s experience, and provide you with the information you need to make your customers happy.\nFor example, you can follow up with customers who left a negative conversation rating and help turn their experience around. Just drill into \"Negative remarks\" to see comments left by your customers. From here, you can follow up with people and resolve their issue.\nSet happiness targets for your team\nYou should set happiness targets for your team, so you ensure the majority of your customers are happy with their experience. For example, hearts and smileys can be counted as positive. Anything else can be counted as negative.\nRewarding your team for exceeding these targets will motivate them to deliver a more personal experience.\nSee happy comments in one place\nHave you ever wondered what your happy customers are saying about you? Simply use\n\u2318 / Ctrl K\nfrom the Help Desk and search for \"Your achievements\".\nYou'll see your achievements appear in the right sidebar in your Inbox. \ud83d\udc47\nYou can see what your customers love about your support. This should provide your team with extra motivation to delight every customer.\nSend conversation ratings when you\u2019re ready\nIf you\u2019re not ready to close a conversation and trigger the conversation rating message, you can\nsnooze\nthe conversation while you\u2019re waiting to resolve the customer\u2019s issue.\nGet better conversation ratings\nIf you\u2019re waiting for a customer to reply, it\u2019s best to\nsnooze\nthe conversation. Then, when the conversation re-opens you\u2019ll be reminded to follow up.

This rule will be superseded by any other CSAT workflow you create.\nWhen multiple agents are involved, who gets the CSAT rating?\nWhen a chatbot (Customer Facing Workflow) sends a CSAT rating survey in a conversation with multiple agents, the rating attribution follows this order:\n1.\tTeammate\n2.\tFin AI Agent\n3.\tChatbot\nOnly one agent can be rated at a time. This means:\nA teammate takes precedence over both Fin and the chatbot.\nFin takes precedence over the chatbot.\nFor example:\nIf all three agents (teammate, Fin, and chatbot) were involved, the teammate will be rated.\nIf only Fin and the chatbot are involved, then Fin will be rated.\nIf only the chatbot was involved, then the chatbot will be rated.\nWho gets the CSAT rating if Fin reached the resolution after teammate already participated in the conversation?\nIf Fin AI Agent participates and resolves a conversation after a human teammate has already participated, CSAT survey will be sent for the last human teammate who participated in the conversation, rather than for Fin.\nFor example, if a teammate passes the conversation to a reusable workflow to let Fin answer and Fin CSAT is turned on, if Fin resolves the conversation the CSAT survey will be sent for the teammate.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nHolistic overview report\nTeammate changes conversation state\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nAsk customers for a conversation rating\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT) reporting"},

Other times, it's best for the conversation to remain with the bot only. With Workflows, you can do either to a high standard by utilising\nactions\n.\n\u200b\nOne way to achieve this is to leave out the \"Collect Customer Reply\" action from pathways while leveraging the \"Reply Buttons\" action. The \"Reply Buttons\" allow you to triage customers without receiving lots of granular details. This can allow for pathways ending with team assignments, tagging, adding\nconversation data attributes\nor passing off to another bot.\nWhen triaging customer issues, you can use the reply buttons to gather the necessary information on your customers. If you want to allow the customer to respond to a prompt along the way, add in the \"Collect Customer Reply\" action. This will leave a gap for the customer to write some more details for you at a time in the triaging where you feel it's appropriate. Below you can see an example path which leverages the customer reply.\nTip:\nWorkflow actions within a path are prioritised from the top to the bottom and will occur in that order. Keep this in mind when designing paths.\nNote:\nWhenever there's a step in the Workflow that expects end user input like \"Collect customer input\", Intercom will wait for 2 seconds to process the next Workflow step after end-user sends their first message with an expectation that end-user may send an another message in next 2 seconds. If there is no message during this period, Workflow will progress with the execution of the next step.\nCan I add a link to a reply button?\nNo, it's not possible to add a link to a reply button, these are specifically for routing users to the next step in the bot.

If you\u2019d like to know your lead\u2019s revenue, for example, give them a multiple choice of ranges instead of asking for one figure.\nAutomatically assign leads with specific answers to specific teams\nYou can create\nBranches\nthat do\nif-then\nchecks and send your leads down relevant paths based on conditions you specify.\nFor example, can check data your leads inputted (like Company size) then route their conversations to the right team or send any relevant follow-up messages:\nCreate follow up rules for different leads\nYou can easily set up more rules if you\u2019d like to take different follow up actions with your leads, based on the answers they\u2019ve given.\nSimply add an action to\nApply rules\nwithin a path.\nThen click on the +\nAdd rule\nto add conditional rules with follow up actions.\nFor example, if you wanted to follow up with qualified leads based on their company size, you could set up two rules to:\nAssign leads from companies with more than 50 employees to your VIP sales team and add the \u2018VIP\u2019 tag.\nAssign leads from companies with fewer than 51 employees to your sales team and add the \u2018SMB\u2019 tag.\nNow, different actions will apply to leads with different company sizes to suit how your sales teams work.\nTo give priority to one rule over another, add it as the first rule or drag and drop it to the top of the list. If a lead triggers one rule, they won\u2019t trigger any of the subsequent rules.\nFAQs\nWhat happens when the lead replies to a conversation that was auto-closed?\nThe conversation will re-open.\nIs it possible to have more than one follow-up as an action?\nYou can only use one use-facing app per follow-up, so you can tag and send to Salesforce, and assign, but only use one app or custom reply, etc.\nIs there any possibility that leads will get into a loop of Operator conversations and not be able to speak with an agent?\nNo, Operator won't put them through the same flow once they've already been qualified or disqualified.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nGenerating leads with Intercom\nMarketo app: Send leads to Marketo and trigger campaigns automatically\nManually qualify leads as you chat\nSimple automations explained\nBuild inbox automations using Workflows"},

From time to time you may need to reorder them to update your customer experience.

You\u2019ll note a small icon always appears beside background Workflows to help you identify them.\nMatching background\nW\norkflows\nCustomers can match multiple background Workflows in order of priority.\nThe main takeaway here is that when you have competing actions like this, they all apply, but it's the bottom Workflow that applies, because its last in the order.\nHow do customers match both types of\nW\norkflows together?\nCustomers only experience\nthe first\ncustomer facing Workflow they match,\nBut they can match multiple background Workflows.\nCustomer context in Workflows\nFor both background and customer-facing Workflows, it's important to understand who the Workflow applies to:\nWhen a Workflow is matched, it always applies to the earliest remaining customer in the conversation. Initially, this is\nthe customer who started the conversation\n.\nIf customers are added to or removed from the conversation, the Workflow will always apply to the earliest remaining customer.\nAll actions, conditions, and matching criteria in the Workflow are based on this earliest remaining customer's attributes and behaviour.\nFor example, if there are multiple customers in the conversation (customer 1, then customer 2, then customer 3, etc.), any person actions, conditions, and matching criteria in the Workflow will always apply to customer 1, until they are removed from the conversation. If customer 1 is removed, the Workflow will then apply to customer 2, and so on.\nFiguring out which Workflows are applying to your conversations\nYou can use the\nInbox Events\ntoggle to expose every Workflow that applies to a conversation.

It's greatly improved our first response times and time to resolution.\"\n- James Laurie, CX Operations Specialist at Up Learn\nIt couldn't be simpler to set up a workflow that instantly routes customer conversations to the right team. This way, your teammates don't need to spend time understanding issues so they can route conversations manually, vastly improving resolution times and teammate efficiency.\nJust head to\nFin AI Agent > Workflows\n, click\n+ New workflow\nand select the template:\nRoute customer conversations to the right team\n.\nSelect\nUse this template\nand then the channel(s) you want your workflow to function on. You can select from Intercom's broad range of channels including Web (Messenger), your iOS or Android app, email, SMS, and social media, ensuring a great experience no matter how your customers contact you.\nIt's a good idea to start small (e.g. on Web) and expand to other channels once you're sure your workflow is working effectively. You can always adjust your channel settings later by selecting the workflow trigger.\nSome workflow steps may not be\navailable on all channels\nor may behave differently.\nWhen you hit\nSave and close\nyou'll find your workflow draft ready for customization. Notice the branches that route customers to different experiences based on attributes you can choose. In the default example, logged in users of your service are shown your expected reply time and routed to a team (currently unassigned), while any other user that does not meet this condition will be asked to log in.\nFor example, you could create a workflow that triages conversations by customer plan, so that you VIP customers get the top-tier support they pay for. To do this, change the attribute on the first branch to\nPlan\nand select the plan name your VIP customers are on, in this case it's\nEnterprise\n.\nLet's give customers on our Enterprise plan our expected reply time and route them straight to our VIP support team. Customers not on the Enterprise plan are prompted to leave their contact information and a description of their problem for our team to respond in due course.\nMore examples\nYou could triage conversation based on detected language, to ensure the customer is routed straight to the right language department.\nOr by office hours.\nOr, if you're feeling adventurous, a combination of all of these and more.\nThe possibilities are endless.\nLearn about setting up\ndata attributes\nyou can use to route conversations.\nWhen you've configured the triage workflow that suits your needs, it's time to set it live.\nRouting customers to the appropriate destination as soon as they contact you ensures they receive accurate and prompt responses, while also optimizing your team's time and efficiency.\nTalk to your team about what routing criteria could work for your support, start with this template for a straightforward setup, and expand its functionality as you become more confident.\nUse this template for your business now:\nUse template\nQuestions?\nOpen the Messenger below for more help from our team.\nMore Workflows templates like this:\nMake wait times a thing of the past by letting Fin AI Agent answer customers right away\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nOrganize team inboxes\nCustomer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\nChoose the right conversation attributes for your business\nCustomer sends their first message\nAsk customers for a conversation rating"},

Branches route through the Workflow by checking each condition. If a condition is met, the Workflow will move on to the path which is connected to this condition.\nIf you use the\nApply rules\naction, the background workflow will look through each path and execute any actions which match the rules you set. This means the workflow can still trigger for other customers, but certain actions will only be taken if they match the rules.\nFor example, if a workflow routes a conversation to your Support team, you could apply rules which check each path and take the following actions IF:\nPlan\nis Pro >\nApply SLA\nPremium Support\nMessage content\ncontains login >\nAssign\nto Cross-Functional Support\nLearn how to use the\nWorkflows builder\nfor all your automations.\nHow orchestration works\nOrchestration is what workflow will run in what order. This explains how workflows with customer-facing content and background workflows work side-by-side.\nCustomer-facing workflows:\nOnly\none\nworkflow with customer-facing content can be running at any point.\nIf the conditions of the conversation change then another workflow with customer-facing content can jump in.\nNote:\nIf, for example, a conversation matches 2 Workflows:\nWorkflow A\n- Customer facing workflow which snoozes the conversation\nWorkflow B\n- Customer facing workflow that is triggered by a teammate closing the conversation.\nIf Workflow A snoozes the conversation and a teammate manually closes the conversation, Workflow A will be interrupted. If you have a Workflow B that is supposed to trigger on conversations close, this Workflow B\nwill not trigger\n, since that workflow A is technically active at the time the conversation is closed, another end-user facing workflow can't be triggered from the close action.\nBackground workflows:\nAll background workflows will run in a conversation if the targeting rules match the conversation. This means you can run multiple background automations at the same time in one conversation (common for tagging).\nAll assignments from background workflows will be deferred until the conversation is moved out of\nbot inbox\n, or the matching customer-facing workflow has finished.\nYou can filter by\nBackground\nto find your background-only automations.

You can also tag, assign, let Fin answer, and route these messages, as well as showing reply time expectations.\nTo get the most out of this trigger, we recommend creating a separate workflow solely for email, as functionality is limited on this channel. By selecting\nEmail\nalongside other channels, the paths and follow up actions available to you will be limited to those available over email.\nBy default, successive workflow and automation messages would be sent as one single consolidated email to the end user.\nEmail predicates\nThere are four email-specific predicates you can use when configuring audience targeting:\nEmail Recipient:\nuse this predicate if you want to target any email address(es) users add to the \"To\" or \"Cc\" fields\nEmail To:\nfor targeting email addresses users add only to the \u201cTo\u201d field\nEmail Cc:\nfor targeting email addresses users add only to the \u201cCc\u201d field\nEmail Bcc:\nfor targeting email addresses users add only to the \"Bcc\" field\nThis will ensure that your automations only trigger in the intended scenarios.\nYou can also use the predicates to create branches within workflows to trigger conditional logic.\nWhen your support team has been cc\u2019d to an email, you can enable Fin to reply to these emails by using \"Email cc\" in the audience targeting (you can also instruct Fin to wait for some time before replying to give your teammates a chance to reply first).\nFor greater flexibility, use the \u201cEmail to\u201d predicate if you would like to create different auto-reply messages (and other steps and actions) depending on the email address a user sends their message to.\nIf you have set up an email auto reply in\nSettings > Channels > Email > Customization\nfor the same target audience as your new omnichannel workflow, the message and actions created on the workflow will override the message in your settings.\nIf a customer has replied to the same email within 2 minutes, workflows are designed not to trigger. This is to prevent potential loops with auto-replies or similar automated email responses.\nSo if a workflow triggered on a customer's email and the customer sends another email within a 2-minute window, the workflow will not run again.\nChannel compatibility\nThe table below highlights which actions are compatible with each available channel.\nKey\n\ud83d\udfe2 = fully supported\n\ud83d\udfe1 = functionality supported, but there may be visual differences between channels\n\ud83d\udfe0 = partially supported (functionality is partially affected)\n\ud83d\udd34 = not supported\nContent\nWeb\niOS\nAndr\nWA\nFB\nIG\nTW\nSMS\nEmail\nWrite a message\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\u21b3 Rich text\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\u21b3 Add emoji\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\u21b3 GIF\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\u21b3 Articles\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\u21b3 Image\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\u21b3 Attachment\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\u21b3 Product tours\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\n\ud83d\udd34\nCollect customer data\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udd34\n\u21b3 Allow customer to update data\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udd34\nExpected reply time\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\nPass to reusable workflow\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\nCustom Action (using API)\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\nSend an app\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\nPause for customer to reply\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\nReply buttons\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udd34\n\u21b3Start over button\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udd34\n\u21b3 Save reply to attribute\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udd34\nCondition\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\nData selection buttons\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe2\n\ud83d\udfe1\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udfe0\n\ud83d\udd34\nNote:\nSend an app\nopens a URL in a new tab (webpage) on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, email, and SMS.\n\u200b\nFor\nFacebook\nand\nInstagram\nintegrations, reply buttons cannot be clicked on by the user, they show as numbers and the user must reply with that number to continue the Workflow.

Create and edit messages, actions, and conditions with ease, then connect them together with path arrows.\nTo create, edit and set Workflows live you must have\npermission\nto send messages to more than one person at a time and both Automation permissions.\nConfigure the trigger settings\nThe first block in the Workflows builder is the\ntrigger\nyou selected. Click on this block to configure the\ntrigger settings\n.\nYou can't change the type of trigger here, you'll need to create a new Workflow and\nchoose a different trigger\n.\nThis is where you'll be able to configure the channel, audience rules, frequency and scheduling, and the goal for this workflow.\nNavigating a Workflow\nFrom the view page, you can see the trigger and a list of paths. From here, you can zoom in and out, pan, and recenter to bring the first path into view using the navigation at the bottom of the canvas.\nAccess these controls from the bottom left of the canvas, or with keystrokes:\nHold\nSpacebar\nthen click and drag to move around the canvas.\nUse\nCommand (Ctrl) +\nto zoom in, or\nCommand (Ctrl) -\nto zoom out\nYou cannot click and drag to move the pathways in the Workflow. All new steps will be created in a neat and organized way.\nYou\u2019ll be able to see the paths of each Workflow laid out horizontally on the canvas, connected to each other with a path arrow.\nNavigate to a path quickly by viewing the\nList of paths\nat the bottom of the canvas.\nThis list will also show a red warning sign and highlight any paths with errors to fix.\nUse \u201cGo to\u201d buttons to move seamlessly between paths in the canvas. Simply hover over a connector (arrow line), the path, or a reply button, and a blue arrow button will appear.\nInstantly tidy up your Workflow with the \"Tidy up the canvas\"\nbutton\nat the bottom of the canvas.\nPaths may jump between columns after clicking this button or refreshing the page.  This is because positions are only calculated when the Workflow loads, and not on every Workflow change.\nBuilding a Workflow from scratch\nAdding a path from the first block\nEvery trigger will always start a new path on the canvas. To begin your workflow, you can customize the reply buttons or start by adding\nactions\n.\nThe first path will change slightly depending on the trigger you selected.\nClick one of the path arrows and choose how to continue from a panel of possible\nmessages\n,\nactions\n, and\nconditions\n:\nThis creates a new path with a connecting arrow:\nThe first path of a workflow has constraints on the different messages and\nactions\nwhich can be used.\nAdding a message, action or condition within an existing path\nAdd further messages, actions, or conditions within a path by clicking 'Add step':\nAdd content to path\nChoose from 8 different messages types:\nSend Bot Message\nCollect data (\ncustom attribute\nto save to users profile or\nconversation data\n)\nPass to a\nreusable workflow\nLet Fin answer\nShow expected reply time\nCollect customer reply (let the customer type)\nSend Ticket\nSend an app.\nAfter selecting your message type, edit the message directly on the canvas. Insert attributes or add emojis, GIFs, articles, images, attachments and tours to the text box.\nIf the message is empty or has an error, it will be highlighted in red for you to clearly see and take action.\nProceed to another path\nYou can also proceed to another path using:\nReply buttons,\nButtons from Custom Objects\n, or\nBranches\n.\nAdd actions\nYou\u2019ll have the option to add a number of\nconversation actions\nto your path. These are not customer-facing and will run in the background.\nApply rules\nTag conversation\nTag person\nAssign conversation\nSnooze\nWait\nMark as priority\nApply SLA\nCustom Action (using API)\n,\nDisable customer reply\nClose conversation\nSet conversation data (predefined)\nAdd integration action (predefined)\nIf you\u2019ve added an action and left it empty or it has an error, it will be highlighted in red for you to clearly see and take action.\nAdd conditional branches to a Workflow\nWith\nBranches\n, you can configure a Workflow to continue to the relevant path depending on specific conditions. To set up branching, click the plus icon below a path or create a new path from an arrow and select\nBranches.\nThen click on\nMissing condition\nto add your conditions:\nNow you can route to the correct path based on the condition(s). For example, if customer is VIP then route to \u201cTier 1 Support\u201d, else provide answers from the Help Center:\nIt\u2019s possible to add multiple conditions to a path by clicking the plus icon below an existing branch. If a user matches multiple conditions, they will proceed down the first path that they match for.\nYou can also use conversation tag predicate in conditional branches in order to navigate to different paths if a certain tag has been assigned to the conversation.\nThere is the option to\nRemove person tag\nor\nRemove conversation tag\nin your Workflow. This action allows you to remove a tag that is already assigned to the person or conversation.\nDeleting a path\nTo delete a path, click on the three dots in the top left corner of the path and select\nDelete path.\nThis automatically removes it from the canvas along with any connections to the path.\nDeleting a path connection\nTo delete a connection, simply click on the arrow between the paths and use the delete/backspace key, or click on the arrow starting a path and then select\nDelete connection\n.\nUnconnected paths will be pushed to the end of the Workflow if you refresh the page or save the Workflow.\nConnecting a path to an existing path\nYou can also connect a path to any other path on the canvas. For example, if you want to connect\nPath A\nto\nPath C\n. Grab the arrow to the right of the reply buttons, conditions or actions, and drag this to the path you\u2019d like to connect.\nPreview a Workflow\nYou can preview your Workflow in Intercom or privately on any webpage, where you\u2019ve installed the Intercom Messenger.\nJust click\nPreview\nin the top right corner.\nThis opens a modal with a live Messenger displaying an interactive preview.\nNote\n:\nIf you\u2019ve just built your Workflow, you\u2019ll need to click\nSave\nit\nbefore you can preview the Workflow.\nYou must fix any path errors before you can save and preview and Workflow.\nWorkflow preview conversations are excluded from reporting.\nWorkflow preview runs with a dedicated logged-in user called\nPreview User\n; these conversations are visible in the Inbox so you can easily test conversations before going live.\nEditing an existing Workflow\nTo make changes to a Workflow, simply click\nEdit\non the view page and make any changes in the visual canvas\nfollowing the steps above\n.\nNo changes are saved or set live in the Workflow until you click\nSave and close\n.\nBest practice advice\nWe often recommend using some emojis to make it personal. We've found that emojis can signify more than a picture in business and personal relationships, and we've tested it too! Check out\nour study\nthat emojis may lead to an increase in customer satisfaction.\nIf a customer reaches the end of the path, but there's no actionable outcome, we recommend a follow-up line when people click the \"\nNo\nthanks\n\" button, and a response like \"\nThat's cool, enjoy exploring our site\n,\" or \"\nLet us know if you need any help later\n.\" Messages like that help you appear more approachable and assistive.\nTry to keep your responses concise. Information provided by bots is typically received better if it's efficient and timely, as if it were a natural conversation.\nRequire new conversations to\nenter an email address\nin the Messenger Settings.\nUse\nvideos in different bot paths\n- simple, lightweight, and smart visual messages help to add more personality.\nConnect a variety of other tools through our\nApp Store\n.\nWant to view conversations that went down a certain path? Add an action to tag any users on that path so you can see who has responded to the bot when you pull up the tag.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nAutomate Switch using Workflows\nOmnichannel support for Workflows\nUsing actions in Workflows\nUsing branches in Workflows\nBuild inbox automations using Workflows"},

The customer will not see anything about the conversation being snoozed and it will remain open.\nNote:\nTeammate adding actions such as tagging will\nnot\ninterrupt the Workflow.\nSnooze steps will get interrupted and finish the workflow if a trigger is processed that moves the conversation away from snoozed in a way which isn't the snooze finishing.\nAutomatically check-in on conversations when a customer has not replied, or been idle for an amount of time.\nFor example, send a message to the customer 24 hours later to see if they still require support.\nWait\nThe\nWait action\ndelays the next step of the workflow \u2014 once the wait duration ends, the next action applies.\nThe wait can be interrupted by the closing action, teammate replies, or by teammate AND customer replies (depending on your set up).\nNote:\nTeammate adding actions such as tagging will\nnot\ninterrupt the Workflow.\nThe Wait action can be used to control when a customer may see an action.\nFor example, teammates can now better control when CSAT is sent by adding a Wait action prior to adding the new CSAT action.\nMark as priority\nThis action will label the conversation as\nPriority\nin the Inbox.\nFor VIP customers, use conditional branching to ensure that all conversations from customers within the company are marked as priority.\nApply SLA\nApplies an SLA (Service Level Agreement) to the conversation. The SLA can be created and configured in\nyour workspace data\n.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNote:\nOnly one SLA can be added. If additional Workflows trigger after the first SLA has been added, the next SLA actions will be ignored.\nSLAs are often used to ensure targets are hit for important customers.\nUse a conditional branch to identify a VIP customer, and apply an SLA to the conversation.\nCustom Action (using API)\nWith this action, a\nCustom Action\nwill be called from the Workflow.\nLearn more about using\nCustom Actions in bots\n.\nCustom Actions are a powerful way to connect Intercom to external APIs.\nFor example, within a Workflow a Custom Action could make a request to an order API to update the customer on their order status.\nAdd a note\nWith this action, you can write an\ninternal note\nwhich will be added to a conversation in the Inbox.\nAdding notes are helpful context for your team.\nFor example, when a customer has been inactive, leave a note to your team prompting them to close the conversation.\nSet ticket state\nSet ticket state action allows to change state of the ticket within a workflow.\nWhen a teammate closes a ticket automatically set the ticket state to resolved.\nNotify Slack channel\nNotify Slack channel action allows workflows to send notifications to public and private Slack channels, teammates have access to.\nAutomatically alert teams to conversation and ticket activity in Slack.\nDisable customer reply\nPrevent customers from writing messages in the Messenger and force them to complete the bot flow.\n\u200b\nNote: To prevent typing when selecting reply buttons, you must turn off the \"let the customer reply\" option in Pathway A and this will prevent the customer from replying for all reply buttons throughout the Workflow.\nDisabling replies in a conversation can be a way to manage inbound volume.\nClose conversation\nThis action will change the status of the conversation to\nClosed\n.\nThere are many use cases for closing a conversation to maintain a healthy Inbox.\nFor example, you might want to close conversations which haven\u2019t received a customer reply for 24 hours.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nUsing the Workflows builder\nAutomate ticket actions using Workflows\nCustomer or teammate has been unresponsive\nHow to trigger a Workflow\nBuild inbox automations using Workflows"},

This means the Workflow will only appear if they match the audience filters.\nWe recommend only using audience rules if you have an additional Workflow to cover everyone who doesn't match.\nFor example, you might have two Workflows, one in French and one in English, and which one is triggered depends on the user's browser language:\nWhen targeting a specific URL It's a good idea to copy and paste it from your app or site directly, as this will catch any characters hidden in your browser's address bar, like trailing slashes.\nOr you can target users\nbased on any data you track about them\n. For example, you could target trial users who signed up 15 days ago.\nYou should also add multiple filters to ensure you target the right audience. For example, you could add:\n\u2018Last seen\u2019 is less than 14 days ago, so you only target active users.\n\u2018Browser language\u2019 is English, so you target users who speak the language of your message.\nYou can use the\nConversation tag\npredicate in audience rules to trigger a Workflow.\nConversation tag predicate won't be available as an audience rule in the following workflow triggers:\nCustomer visits a page\nCustomer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\nCustomer clicks on a website element\nYou can also use the Conversation starter predicate in audience rules to trigger a Workflow based on how the conversation started in Intercom. For example, if you want to trigger a Workflow if the customer replies to a Workflow with the trigger \"Customer visits a page\".\nHere is a breakdown of what each Conversation starter option means:\nCustomer message: Conversation was started via an inbound message from the customer.\nTeammate sending direct message: Conversation was started by the teammate using the\nNew Conversation\noption in the Inbox.\nTeammate sending to many customers: Conversation was started by the teammate starting a new conversation from the inbox with multiple customers.\nWorkflow: Conversation was started by a \"customer visits a page\" workflow.\nOutbound message: Conversation was started by an outbound message sent from the Outbound tab. (This\ndoes not\ninclude direct messages sent from the inbox, e.g. Teammate sending direct message or Teammate sending to many customers.)\nThe more targeted you make your audience, the more effective your Workflow will be.\n\u200b\nCombine 'And' with 'Or' filters\nif you need more flexible audience targeting.\nPreview audience\nYou'll be able to preview the number and name of existing customers who could match your Workflow once it\u2019s set live\nScheduling\nChoose when to start and stop sending the Workflow to your customers by enabling\nScheduling.\nFor example, with a Workflow that stops at the same time that another Workflow starts, or one Workflow during your office hours, and one for outside of office hours:\nYou can also select\nAt custom times\nto show your Workflows. Click the start time, then hold 'Shift' key and click the end time. Your Workflow will then show for customers during the selected period.\nNote:\nCustom times are only available on certain\nIntercom plans\n. You may need to upgrade your plan to use this feature.\nTrigger times are based on your\nworkspace\u2019s timezone\n.\nTo find your busiest times, check out the\nConversations report\n. Then set up a Workflow to help your team, when they need it most.\nGoal\nNote:\nGoals are only available for Workflows using the trigger \"When customer visits a page.\"\nBefore setting your Workflow live, you should set a goal, so you can accurately measure it's impact. This is the action you'd like your customers to take, or the change that should occur as a result of receiving the Workflow.\nFor example, if you're using a Workflow to encourage customers to upgrade from a free trial to a paid plan, you might set the goal \"plan is paid\":\nYou can also define the time limit for this change or action to occur, e.g. users must match this within 30 days.\nThe shorter the time period, the more confidently you can attribute the change to your workflow.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nOmnichannel support for Workflows\nHow to trigger a Workflow\nAuto-close incomplete Workflows conversations\nTroubleshooting when a Workflow doesn't trigger\nWorkflows FAQs"},

If no teammate is visible, we check for a Fin AI Agent, and then Chatbot (Customer Facing Workflow).\nThe Workflow will only send one CSAT survey per Support Agent in a conversation.\nReopened conversations\nWhen a customer asks a new question in a closed conversation, it can be reopened.\nIn the example Workflow above, using the \"\nTeammate changes conversation state\n\" trigger, if the teammate changes the conversation state to closed, the CSAT survey will be sent again. This gives the customer an opportunity to update their rating.\nIf you don't want the CSAT survey to be sent again, you can branch on a condition before the\n\"Ask for conversation rating\"\naction. This condition should check whether the Conversation data for CSAT request\nwas false.\nYou can also have a more granular control over when a CSAT request is shown in a conversation by using the \u201cConversation Rating Requested for Agent\u201d predicate.\nYou can use it in audience rules or branches to target customers who\u2019ve received a CSAT request for specific agent type: Teammate, Fin, or Chatbot:\nPrevent customers from rating after a given period of time\nClick on the CSAT widget if you want to \"Prevent customers from rating after a given period of time\" and then specify the days/hours/minutes.\nNote:\nCustomers will still be able to see and interact with the CSAT survey in the Messenger, but their response won't be recorded after this period of time.\nThis setting can also be configured in\nBasics\nwhich will be used as a fallback if there is no value set in the CSAT widget.\nPrevent customers from\nchanging\ntheir rating after a given period of time\nClick on the CSAT widget if you want to \"Prevent customers from\nchanging\ntheir rating after a given period of time\" and then specify the hours.\nNote:\nThis setting will not prevent customers from submitting an initial rating, it will only prevent them from\nchanging\ntheir rating. Use the \"Prevent customers from rating after a given period of time\" toggle instead if you don't want customers to leave any rating after the specified time.\nThis setting can also be configured in\nBasics\nwhich will be used as a fallback if there is no value set in the CSAT widget.\nWait for customers to give a rating before continuing the Workflow\nClick on the CSAT widget and toggle on \"Wait for customers to give a rating before continuing the Workflow\".\nThis ensures that the workflow pauses until a customer provides a rating, allowing you to take specific actions based on the response using conditional\nbranches\n(see example below).\n\u200b\nAllow customers to type while waiting\nOptional\nYou can also select the checkbox \"Allow customers to type while the workflow is waiting for a rating\". This means that after the CSAT survey is sent, the composer will remain enabled, allowing the customer to send a message. If the customer does send a message, it will interrupt the workflow (pausing any subsequent steps you may have set up).\nLearn how to measure CSAT in conversations where\nFin AI Agent\nand\nchatbots\nare involved.\nWant even more flexibility?\nIf you're looking to get even more flexibility on CSAT, such as changing the rating presentation, you can build your own CSAT Workflow using the same trigger (\"Teammate changes conversation state\") and clicking the\nClosed\nstate.\nBut instead of applying the CSAT action, you can build your own flow using reply buttons to create your own rating scale (e.g. a 1-10 NPS scale, or your own preferred emojis or text).\nThen configure what should happen when customers click the buttons, such as routing a low-scoring conversation to a team.\nThis will also trigger if closing a\nCustomer ticket\nthat was converted from a conversation.\nHow does reporting work for custom CSAT workflows?\nTo report on your own configured CSAT Workflow, make sure to apply a custom data attribute to your reply buttons.\nThis can be done by first creating a conversation data attribute in the settings\nhere\nusing the text format. This will then appear as an option under the reply value button.\nThis will allow you to use\nCustom reports\nto report on your own configured CSAT, segmenting conversations by ratings and exporting the raw data to calculate your CSAT scores.\nThe built-in\nCustomer satisfaction report\nwill\nnot\napply to your own configured CSAT ratings, as this report depends on the pre-configured CSAT action.\nFAQs\nHow do I opt a customer out of receiving future rating requests?\nThere may be times where you want to opt a specific customer out of receiving any future CSAT ratings. The simplest way to achieve this is to create a\nTag\nwhich you can use to Tag user profiles that you wish to opt out of receiving rating requests.\nWhen you create your Workflow, you can use a\nbranch\nto create two pathways. The first will send the rating if the user does not have the tag. The second will just keep the conversation closed if the user has the tag.\nHow do I opt a specific conversation out of receiving a rating request?\nThere currently isn't a way to opt a conversation out of receiving a rating and this is not a feature that we are planning on building in the near future however you can upvote it in the Product Wishlist\nhere\n. Note that you must be logged into the Intercom Community to view the Wishlist.\nAs a workaround, you can create a\nconversation data attribute\nthat allows teammates to choose if a rating should be sent or not.\nFirst, create a conversation data attribute visible to your team under\nSettings > Data > Conversations:\n\u200b\nNext, use this attribute in your CSAT Workflow. For example, here we have created an attribute called \"opt out of csat rating?\" with the options of Yes or No which will be visible to teammates on the right hand side of the Help Desk.\nYou can use a\nbranch\nto create two pathways. The first pathway will send the rating if the attribute is NOT yes. This means that it will send the rating if the attribute is blank or has been set to no.\nThe else path will close the conversation if the attribute has been set to Yes:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nCustomer or teammate has been unresponsive\nTroubleshooting when a Workflow doesn't trigger\nAnalyze and report on Fin AI Agent CSAT\nChatbot CSAT\nAsk customers for a conversation rating"},

This ensures your team's availability aligns perfectly with your operational needs for each branch of the IVR.\nGive reply options\nUse reply options for customer input. To add a reply option, click\n+ Add step\nand select\nReply options\nfrom the dropdown.\nEnter an\nintroduction message\nwhich will be converted to speech, or upload an Audio Snippet you\u2019ve recorded. This message should introduce and match the reply options you give below.\nNow enter the reply option for each key, e.g. \u201cFor support PRESS 1\u201d.\nMake sure your introduction message matches the reply options, as the introduction message will be what your customer hears on the phone.\nClick the\n+ Add button\nfor:\nReply option\n- add another reply option for a different path.\nStart over button\n- add a start over option for customers to go back to the start of the Workflow\nSave reply value to attribute\n- Save the reply option each customer selects as\nattributes\nfor reporting and teammate context.\nAdd actions\nBased on the reply option a customer selects, you can take actions using the red arrows. For example, select\nHold and assign call\nto pass the call to your team. The call will ring to an available teammate, if the teammate declines the call then it will be assigned to the next available teammate.\nThis step must come at the end of a path.\nA call will be part of a conversation you can view on the Help Desk. This means standard conversation actions can also be applied, such as tag conversation, mark as priority, add note, set conversation data, etc.\nClick on the\nHold and assign call\nwidget to select the team.\nYou can also select when the call is considered 'unanswered' by configuring which conditions must be met. Then click\nSave and close.\nNow decide what happens if the call is unanswered. Unanswered calls can be assigned to another team or you can choose one of the available call deflection options (e.g. send to voicemail or forward call to a secondary team).\nYou must include a call ending step, such as\nSend to voicemail\n,\nForward call\n, or\nHang up\n, to ensure calls are properly concluded within your designed flow.\nSend to voicemail\nThe\nSend to voicemail\nstep can be used to deflect calls to voicemail (e.g. when the team is unavailable, or is out of office hours). Click on the\nSend to voicemail\nwidget to customize the voicemail greeting which will be played when an end user is transferred to voicemail.\nThe voicemail greeting can support multiple languages.\nChoose to set follow-up actions, or add rules based on information you\u2019ve collected during the Workflow.\nAllow callbacks\nThe\nRequest callback\nstep can be added as a call overflow option. This is useful for situations when your team is busy, out of office, or the wait queue is too long.\nIn these scenarios, you can offer your customers an option to request a callback or stay in the queue and wait on hold (or offer other deflection options). If the customer requests a callback, they will keep their place in the call queue and the callback request will be\nshown to teammates in the inbox\n.\nSimply add the\nRequest callback\nstep to your Workflow, then inform the customer that a callback will be requested using a voice recording or the TTS (text-to-speech) functionality.\nIn order to make callbacks, you need to have outbound calls enabled for phone numbers you\u2019ll want to make outbound calls from. You can turn this on from your\nphone number settings\n.\nForward calls\nYou are able to use the\nForward call\naction if you want to automatically forward the call to an external number, e.g. a live answering service or an external team.\nForwarded calls will be charged as an outbound call to the receiving number.\nClick on the\nForward call\nwidget to enter the external phone number, set follow-up actions after the call is transferred, or add rules based on information you\u2019ve collected during the Workflow.\nHang up\nUse this action to hang up the call for the customer. For example, you might like to add the\nHang up\naction to a path if a customer calls outside of office hours.\nThis step must come at the end of a path.\nClick on the\nHang up\nwidget to set follow-up actions after the call ends (such as close conversation), or add rules based on information you\u2019ve collected during the Workflow.\nAsk for call rating\nAdd the\nAsk for call rating\nstep to immediately collect customer feedback at the end of a call with your team. This is super useful for gauging call satisfaction and providing valuable insights for continuous improvement.\nCall ratings will be available in the\nCustomer satisfaction report\nand in\nCustom reports\n.\nSimply click on the\nAsk for call rating\nwidget to customize the text to speech message which will be played when asking for feedback.\nThe message can support multiple languages.\nRemember, you must include a call ending step, such as\nSend to voicemail\n,\nForward call\n, or\nHang up\n, at the end of each path to ensure calls are properly concluded within your designed flow.\nIn order for a teammate to be assigned a phone call, they must be a member of the team to which the call is routed.\nSLAs\nare not currently supported for phone calls and so you won't find an SLA option under 'Add action' in your workflow.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall and set up Switch\nIntercom Phone explained\nManage phone availability\nTake calls from the Inbox\nPhone Reusable Workflows"},

They can clarify why they\u2019re getting in touch, and provide extra info without needing to wait for a response, or take up your team\u2019s time.\nTo create, edit and set Workflows live you must have permission to send messages to more than one person at a time and both Automation\npermissions\n.\nFor example, if you know most of your conversations are support requests, feature requests, and bug reports you could create quick replies for these three options. Your bot will then collect any extra info you need and route them to the right team.\nIf your suggested replies don't match a customer's issue, you can still give them the option to write a reply in the composer.\nGet started\nGo to\nFin AI Agent > Workflows\nand click\nNew workflow\n.\nYou can either get started quickly with a prebuilt template such as \"Triage issues and assign to different teams\".\nOr, click\nCreate from scratch\nto build your own Workflow using the trigger \"Customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\".\nPrebuilt templates can also be customized to suit your needs, but they give you a framework to start with.\nTrigger rules and scheduling\nChoose when to trigger your Workflow\nYou can add page rules to only trigger a Workflow if a user is visiting a certain page. This allows you to give your users the most relevant options, in any context.\nFor example, if you choose\nWeb\nas your channel, you can add a page rule so your bot only triggers on conversations started from the pricing page:\nLearn more about configuring your\ntrigger settings\n.\nChoose your audience\nYou can target users\nbased on any data you track about them\n. For example, you could add an audience rule that targets free users and then include replies to help with signing up.\nLearn how to\ncombine multiple rules\nusing And / Or filters if you need more specific audience targeting.\nSchedule your bot\nControl when customers see your Workflow by setting up\nFrequency and scheduling\n.\nThis will help your team manage conversation volume during busy periods. Or, you could show bots outside of\noffice hours\nso customers help themselves while you\u2019re away.\nLearn more about\nscheduling Workflows\n.\nOnce you've finished setting up your trigger rules, click\nSave and close\nto start building your Workflow.\nBuild your Workflow\nAdd a title\nYour title should accurately describe your Workflow's function, so your teammates can easily understand its purpose.\nAdd or edit the welcome message and reply buttons\nStart your first path with a clear question explaining the options your customers will see. Simply click on a reply button to edit the text.\nYou don\u2019t need to cover every possible scenario, as customers can still write a reply in the composer if none of your suggested replies cover their question.\nHowever, if you'd like to prevent customers from replying directly, you can choose to toggle off the option to\nLet customer type\n.\nThis option will only apply in your mobile app with\nmobile SDKs v6.1.0 and higher\n.\nAdd new paths\nNow, you can direct users down new paths based on their replies. Each path lets you collect all the right information to help your customers.\nJust click on an arrow beside each reply button to add a new path.\nThese paths can ask for more information, or even provide quick answers to common questions, like this example which directs your customer to a path with specific steps to export their data:\nWhen asking for more information you can allow your customers to type freely (or attach images), or collect data as a\nstandard or custom attribute\n. Just click\n+ Add step\nbelow the message.\nAttributes can only be added once by your customer. If a value already exists for the attribute, only a\nteammate can change it\n.\nBuild customized follow up actions\nAt the end of each path, you can choose to continue a Workflow with more reply buttons to direct users onto a new path, or end with follow up\nactions\n. Just click\n+\nAdd step\nat the bottom of a path, and go to the\nAdd action\nsection or search for the action you need.\nYou can add as many follow up actions as you like. For example, if a user selects \"I want to submit a bug report\", and has gone down a path to provide details, you could:\nAssign the conversation to your Customer Support Engineers,\nTag the conversation as a Bug report, and\nMark the conversation as priority.\nYou can also add\nconditional branches\nbased on the data your Workflow collects.\nCheck for errors\nWhen you've finished, check and fix any path errors. These will be highlighted in red on the canvas and you can easily edit them.\nSet it live\nWhen you're ready, scroll back to the top where you can preview your Workflow, save and close the builder, or set it live \ud83c\udf89\nYou'll need to save a Workflow before you can\npreview\nit for the first time.\nHow do Workflows work alongside other bots and automations?\nFin AI Agent and Suggested help articles\nIf you use\nFin\n, or the\n\u2018Suggest help articles\u2019\nautomation, they will only send if your customer skips the quick replies you\u2019ve defined and writes a new message in the composer.\nConversation ratings\nIf you have conversation ratings enabled for users, Workflow messages are included in the word count required to trigger conversation ratings. If the conversation matches all the\nminimum requirements\n, then a conversation rating will send when it\u2019s closed.\nService level agreements (SLAs) and First response time\nYour team\u2019s\nfirst response time\n, and\nSLA calculations\nwill include the time that users spend interacting with Workflows by default. You can exclude time spent interacting with a bot from your SLAs by enabling the dedicated bot inbox.\nLearn how to enable the bot inbox here\n.\nOther ways to triage conversations\nWorkflows are perfect for triaging support questions, but there are more situations where you can use Workflows to give your customers the best possible experience:\nHigh-level categorization\nIf your company offers multiple products or services, a Workflow can help your customers self-select which product they need help with. That way, the teammate who picks up the conversation will already have this context.\nSurface contextual information about an event, update, or outage\nThere are many things that can cause a surge in certain questions, like changes to your product\u2019s layout, time sensitive events, or even an outage.

Your reply time is configured in\nMessenger Settings\n.\nRoute existing customer to support\nYou can route leads to the right people by asking if they are an existing customer. Decide what you want to do when they choose \u2018Yes, I'm a customer\u2019:\nAssign the conversation to a team or teammate, or\nClose the conversation and offer at least one alternative channel for them to contact you on.\nAsk for contact details\nIf you don\u2019t already have their contact details, you can automatically collect their contact details with the \"Ask for contact details\" simple automation. This will ask that customers leave their email address or their phone number to get notified whenever you reply. You can decide to ask for\nemail only\nor\nemail or mobile number\n.\nAlternatively, you can\nrequire an email at the beginning of the conversation\n, or you can ask for an email in\nQualify leads\nin the next step \ud83d\udc47\nQualify leads\nChoose to qualify leads by asking for more information.\nLeads will be qualified using the information you select here. For example, you might like to collect:\nName\nEmail\nPhone number\nCompany industry\nCompany size\nAdd follow up rules\nAfter you've collected qualification data, you can now take follow up actions with leads who match certain rules. Click\n+ Add rule\nto set up\nif data is x then take y action.\nFor example:\nIf\n- A lead says their Company industry is \u2018e-commerce\u2019,\nThen\n- Assign to your sales rep to follow up.\nIf adding multiple data qualifications and actions to the same rule, you can also decide whether the lead needs to:\nMatch all\n- All data must be matched for the action(s) to be taken, or\nMatch any\n- Any of the data can be matched for the action(s) to be taken.\nWhen adding multiple different rules, the order of your rules is important because only the first rule a lead matches will be applied. See example below \ud83d\udc47\nIf a lead says their company industry is \u2018e-commerce\u2019\nand\ntheir company size is '150', then they have matched both rules, but only the first rule will be applied (actions from the second rule won't be taken).\nWhen a conversation with a lead is closed\nAsk for conversation rating\nThe following settings can be toggled on/off for conversation ratings:\nSending for direct outbound conversations.\nNot sending rating requests for outbound conversations started via the API or Workflows.\nPrevent customers from rating after a given period of time.\nPrevent customers from changing their rating after a given period of time.\nYou can also choose whether to use the Intercom CSAT app to collect feedback, or use your own app you\u2019ve installed on your workspace.\nIf you want more flexibility, upgrade to\nWorkflows\nto customize automations with bots, triggers, conditions, and rules that create amazing customer and teammate experiences \u2014 all in one place.\nFAQs\nWhen does a simple automation ask visitors for their details?\nWhere possible, the\nQualify leads\nautomation will give you the chance to respond in real-time to your lead's message before it asks for their contact details. Here\u2019s how it works:\nWhen you\u2019re unlikely to reply fast, the automation will ask for your lead's contact details right away.\nBut if your automatic response time is less than 10 minutes or you\u2019ve selected \u2018Typically replies in a few minutes\u2019 as your\nreply time\n, the automation will give you the chance to respond first. If you haven\u2019t replied to your lead after 2 minutes, the automation will ask for their details.\nThis works with all Mobile SDKs that support Workflows (5.3.0 and newer), however an improved experience is available on SDK versions > 7.1.0. When a customer downgrades to a plan without the\nQualify leads\nautomation, it\u2019ll be paused.\nHow do leads get notified of a reply by SMS?\nWhen leads opt to get notified by SMS and leave their phone number, the bot will send them an SMS notifying them of your reply.\nAs soon as they tap on the link they\u2019ll be brought to the mobile web Messenger to read your message there.\nAdditional details on SMS:\nA simple automation waits 3 minutes before sending the SMS (this is how long we wait before sending an email too). If the lead has already seen the reply in the Messenger, then we don't send the SMS. This prevents unnecessary notifications when the user is having a real-time conversation.\nLeads can\u2019t reply directly to the SMS. They\u2019ll need to read and reply to your message from the Messenger instead.\nOnce a lead adds their phone number, the simple automation will notify them of all of your conversation replies by SMS. If they want to opt-out, you can delete their phone number in the user profile in your\nContacts\n.\nIf a lead writes in from any of these countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, or the US, we send the SMS from a local number. Otherwise we default to sending it from a US number.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nRequire leads to give their email to start a conversation\nControl inbound conversation volume\nCustomize the Switch experience\nAutomatically qualify leads using Workflows\nMeasure customer satisfaction with conversation ratings"},
{"url": "https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/7669340-mobile-sdk-faqs", "title": "Mobile SDK - FAQs", "content": "General\nWhat is the size of Intercom mobile SDKs?\nThe size of the SDKs will vary but Mobile SDK sizes are roughly:\niOS\n: ~9mb\nAndroid\n: ~7mb (will shrink on install with any shared dependencies etc.)\nThis will differ based on configuration.\nPlatforms and support\nDo you have any Xamarin Support?\nNo, you will have to rely on community libraries if it is needed.\nDo you have any React Native Support?\nWe do! Our React Native wrapper was released June 24, 2021. Installation information can be found in our Developer Docs\nhere\n.\nDo you have any Ionic support?\nOfficially, we do not support Ionic. However, Intercom may work with both Ionic 1 & 2. To use the Intercom with Ionic, run the following:\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-intercom\nMake sure you initialize Intercom correctly.\nIonic 1\nFor Ionic 1 you can use Intercom like this:\n.run(function($ionicPlatform) {\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\ncordova.plugins.intercom.registerIdentifiedUser({userId: \"123456\"});\ncordova.plugins.intercom.setLauncherVisibility('VISIBLE');\n});\n})\nIonic 2\nFor Ionic 2 you need to add the folling variable to your app.component.ts:\ndeclare var cordova:any;\nYou can then use Intercom like this:\nthis.platform.ready().then(() => {\ncordova.plugins.intercom.registerIdentifiedUser({userId: \"12345\"});\ncordova.plugins.intercom.setLauncherVisibility('VISIBLE');\n});\nKeep in mind that this method of installation is not officially supported.\nIs there a minimum required iOS SDK version?\nTo receive updates for the Intercom iOS SDK you will be required to have the minimum version of iOS 13. With that being said, we will continue to support customers on earlier versions of iOS, however, no updates will be made for these legacy versions.\nFeatures\nDoes the Messenger work in mobile apps?\nYes! But, the\nMessenger\nworks slightly differently in mobile apps, compared to desktop. This article explains how to update your SDKs to work with the new Messenger, and which features are supported on iOS and Android apps.\nWhat\u2019s available with Messenger in mobile apps?\nWhen visitors or users access the Messenger on your iOS or Android app, they'll be able to engage with the Help and Messages Spaces\nif you have these enabled\n, as well as apps you add to your Home Space - so they can do more than chat.\nThey'll also be able to start conversations with you and submit\ntickets\n.\nYour customers can send images & GIFs, but uploading other files is not currently supported on mobile.\nLearn more about customizing and using the new Messenger on mobile here\n.\nDoes Intercom mobile SDK support multiple languages?\nWhen Intercom is loaded in your mobile app, the user's language is detected based on the language of the OS. The Messenger will load in the user's language if it is\nsupported in your workspace\n. If your workspace doesn't support their language, the Messenger will load in your workspace's default language.\nIntercom\ndoes not\nautomatically track mobile user's language in an attribute on their profile like we do for web. For user's loaded in the Messenger on the web, Intercom tracks their language in the \"Browser language\" attribute, which is\nonly applicable to web integrations\n.\nIf you want to target outbound content at mobile users based on language, you will need to set up tracking yourself. You can either use the\nlanguage_override\nattribute to track mobile user language, or create a custom attribute to track language.\nDoes Intercom mobile SDK support video upload on mobile?\nAt the moment we support video uploads on Android SDK.\nDo the mobile SDKs support Right To Left languages(RTL)?\nCurrently, we don't officially support RTL in the mobile SDKs. However, newer features in the SDKs such as the Help Center do support it, which is why you will see a reference to RTL in newer releases of the SDKs. We do plan to fully support RTL in the future but for now, we don't currently support RTL.\nHow can I use Intercom to display announcements like a splash screen?\nIntercom doesn't offer a specific splash screen feature, but you can use outbound messages like\nChats and Posts\nto achieve a similar effect. Chats can be used to announce something to your customers through the Intercom Messenger and prompt them to start a conversation. Posts can be used to make an announcement in your product that will immediately get the attention of your customers and can be sent in two sizes, Small or Large.\nCan I send messages to specific screens in my mobile app?\nIt's not possible to send a message to users of your mobile app on specific screens.\nHowever, as a workaround, you can begin tracking a custom attribute, let's call it '\ncurrent_screen'\n, and then  update that attribute with an identifier (\ni.e. a name or an ID\n) of the screen whenever your users navigate to a different screen in your mobile app. This can be done for all screens, or perhaps just the ones you anticipate targeting with an auto-message.\nAfter implementing the attribute you can configure the rule '\ncurrent_screen is splashScreen\n' in your targeted audience to send a message only to users who are on the splash screen.\nDoes Intercom track any extra attributes about users via mobile SDKs?\nOnce a the mobile SDK is installed in a workspace, extra attributes will be main available in the web interface\nFor iOS/Android\nIs mobile unidentified\nunidentified users are those that have not logged in an email/user_id (similar to leads in the web integration but remember that all mobile SDK records are\nusers\n)\nEnabled Push Messaging\nindicates that the record as a device token and thus can receive push messaging/notifications\nNote:\nThe mobile SDK attribute 'Enabled Push Messaging' is only ever set to 'True' or 'Unknown'. If a user has a device token attached to their user profile, 'Enabled Push Messaging' will return true. Otherwise, it will return 'Unknown'.\nFor Android\nLast seen on android\nAndroid sessions\nAndroid app version\nAndroid device\nAndroid os version\nFor iOS\nLast seen on ios\nIos sessions\nIos app version\nIos device\nIos os version\nWhen are mobile sessions incremented?\nHere is a link to our article exploring this\niOS\nWe increment the iOS session count the first time a user is registered\nAnd subsequently on every\nUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification\nthat is triggered by a user opening your app,\nonce they happen twenty seconds apart\n.\nApplication opens within twenty seconds are not counted.\nAndroid: follows similar rules\nIs there a difference in\nApp Version\ntype attributes?\niOS App version is of string type\nAndroid App Version is of \"version\" type allowing greater then and less than\nDo Product Tours work on mobile?\nProduct Tours\nlet you create guided in-app experiences for your customers, so you can drive better adoption.\nProduct Tours works on desktop only. It doesn't currently work on mobile devices (including tablets) in the browser or in mobile apps.\nFor an engaging, multi-step experience in your Mobile app, try Mobile Carousels.\nDo Workflows work on mobile?\nYes, they do!\nAre there known connectivity issues for customers in Vietnam?\nYes there are.\nIf you or your customers located in Vietnam are having connectivity issues with the intercom.com domain in our mobile SDKs, you can override the default domain name following these steps:\nA\nndroid\nAdd the following meta-data in your app's AndroidManifest.xml:\n<meta-data\nandroid:name=\"io.intercom.android.sdk.host\"\nandroid:value=\".intercom-messenger.com\" />\ni\nOS\nAdd this attribute in your Info.plist:\nKey: IntercomCustomURL\nType: String\nValue: intercom-messenger.com\nWith this change, all API requests will go through intercom-messenger.com instead of mobile-messenger.intercom.com.\nThis is supported on Android SDK 9.1.2+ and iOS SDK 13+.\nHow are push notifications sent from Intercom?\nWhile there are differences between how Apple and Android handle push, the principles are the same illustrated below\nRequest for push device token:\nWhen an app wants to use push notifications and a user accepts the permissions dialog, a request is sent to the relevant push service for a push device token. This token is the \u2018address\u2019, allowing the push service to deliver a push to a specific device when requested (similar to an email address)\nPush device token sent:\nIf the request is valid, the push service will return a valid token to the device.\nPush device token passed to Intercom\nA token must be sent from the device to another service to be used for push. It may be sent to an app developer\u2019s own server, to Intercom, to another third party, or all of the above. When this token is received on Intercom's end, we attach it to the user record.\nPush package sent from Intercom to Apple/Google\nWhen a push notification is to be sent the following information needs to be sent to the Apple/Google push servers:\nDevice Token\nNotification details (e.g. logo, title, body)\nAuthentication details (which allows us to send push on behalf of the app: this is where Apple iOS certificates and Google Android GCM/FCM keys come into play and need to be updated in the Intercom Settings dashboard)\nPush notification sent to device\nIf Intercom authenticates to the push service for a given token, the push will be sent to the device\nPush services do use Quality of Service (QOS)\nUsing Intercom mobile SDKs\nCan you initialize / switch multiple app_ids dynamically\nIt is currently not possible to switch between multiple ids on Android.\nIntercom.registerForLaterInitialisation(this)\nallows only for later initialisation, but it is not meant for switching app ids.\nIt will, however, work on iOS.\nDo the Android/iOS mobile SDKs maintain session data on uninstalling and reinstalling of the app?\nNo they do not\nFor iOS: the apps are sandbox so the new installation will not have awareness of any previous install.\nFor Android: all the data will be gone on uninstall\nIf an app is upgraded e.g. via App/Play Store or in development mode, the session data will be maintained.\nHow does Intercom store session data on the mobile device of an app using our SDK?\nWe store a file identity.icm that contains an anonymous UserId for unidentified users. For identified users we store their email (if they have provided one), their userid and intercom id. We use this to prevent re-registering a previously registered user. In terms of a session and whether we create a new one, this is determined by the time interval since the last session. The default here is 20 seconds. We don\u2019t store anything on disk to track this.\nCan the Android SDK be installed on an app that doesn't have Google Play Services i.e. the app is installed via Huawei App Gallery instead of Google Play Store?\nNo, Google Play Services are required for our Android SDK.\nWhere can I find my Mobile API key?\nYour mobile API Keys can be found by hovering over your avatar profile photo on the lower left of the screen when logged-in to Intercom, and then choosing\nSettings > Installation > iOS\n/\nAndroid\n:\nAlso, if you haven't checked out our installation guides for\niOS\n,\nAndroid\n, and/or\nCordova\n,\nReact Native\n, we recommend giving those a read! \ud83d\ude0a\nCan I import device tokens into Intercom?\nNo, device tokens cannot be imported into Intercom.\nWhy does the Intercom mobile SDK include Sentry's SDK and when does the Sentry SDK initialize?\nOur mobile SDKs come with the Sentry SDK installed in them. This is used to help us track issues with the mobile SDKs. When performance data is sent to Sentry it is done so with PII data removed so there shouldn't be cause for concern around end user data being sent to Sentry.\nThe way the Sentry SDK operates is not the same for the iOS SDK and the Android SDK. For the iOS SDK, the Sentry SDK gets initialized right away, without the need for Intercom's iOS SDK to get initialized. It is not possible to change this behaviour as we need to initialize the Sentry SDK first in order to get accurate crash analytics for the Intercom SDK.\nWith the Android SDK, we do not initialize the Sentry SDK until the Intercom SDK is initialized. This is because the Android SDK does not use the default Sentry Android integration. It uses a lower level java library to send custom events to sentry. We are therefore able to control when it is initialized in the lifecycle.\nHow can I manage user sessions and authentication with the Intercom Android SDK, and what are the best practices for handling user state?\nThe Intercom Android SDK handles user sessions internally. Once a user is logged in using Intercom.loginIdentifiedUser(), the session is persisted, and there\u2019s no need to re-authenticate the user every time the app starts. The SDK caches the login state locally and maintains it until you explicitly call Intercom.logout().\nTo keep your app\u2019s logic in sync with Intercom, ensure you log the user into Intercom at the same time you log them into your app, and call Intercom.logout() when they log out. This keeps the authentication state aligned across your system and Intercom.\nYou can optionally store user data (e.g., ID, email) in your app to help manage the current session state, but Intercom does not require you to re-store or re-identify the user unless the app is reinstalled or the user explicitly logs out.\nWhy does the \"\nback\"\nbutton send the user back to the home screen when the user selects a push notification from their notification bar?\nThe launcher activity of your app is not added to the back stack, so selecting the\nback\nbutton, after selecting a notification from an Intercom Message, returns the customer to the Home screen instead of the screen in the app that was launched to open the Messenger.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nInstall and use Intercom in your mobile app\nGet started with Mobile Push\nDesign and build a Mobile Carousel\nAdding images to mobile push messages\nIntercom developer FAQs"},

(Horizontal alignment can be set on each element individually.)\nColors\n- Background, Text & Buttons.\nBest practices:\nWe recommend including a close button for your users, on non-critical carousels like new feature announcements, or promotions.\nFor optimal targeting of your carousel and a personalized experience, we recommend creating one carousel for each operating system (Android & iOS).\nYou can also switch between an Android or iOS preview:\nNote:\nThere is no iPad or tablet preview, but Android tablets and iPads are supported.\nOn an Android tablet, the carousel will take up the whole screen like in the Android preview.\nOn an iPad, the carousel will display in a centered modal:\nRun an A/B or control group test\nThis is also the screen where you can start a new test on your carousel.

This makes it more likely that users will allow them. \ud83d\udc4c\nOn the\nfinal screen\nof a carousel you can also add a button to:\nOpen an external link. \u2014 Perfect for a social sharing URL, or link to a review site.\nOpen a deep link to a page in your app. \u2014 Ideal if you\u2019re promoting a specific feature or product.\nStart a conversation in the Intercom Messenger. \u2014 For a simple way to connect with, and support your customers.\nNote:\nAll of these actions will automatically close the carousel.\nImportant:\nIf you choose one of these options for the button on your final screen, then add another screen, or move this screen, the button action will switch to \u2018navigate to the next screen\u2019 because these actions are only available on the final screen of a carousel.\nNote:\nLocalization is currently not built into the Mobile Carousel tool, meaning that you would need to create separate carousels for each language if you'd require them in different languages.\nThings to note about requesting device permissions\nWhen a user of your app accepts a request for device permissions (like location), the native system dialogue will open so they can grant the permission:\nIf they\u2019ve already granted the permission, this screen in the carousel will be skipped.\nIf they\u2019ve previously denied the permission, the screen will be shown and the \u2018accept\u2019 button will open the app settings on their device. The carousel will still be there when they return to the app.\nOn Android, push notification permissions are granted by default. This screen will be skipped unless they have previously denied the permission.\nImportant:\nTo request push notifications permission, your app developers must have set up the Intercom mobile SDK for push notifications. Our developer documentation covers how to do this:\nPush notifications for Android\nPush notifications for iOS\nPush notifications for React Native\nSend your carousel\nOnce you\u2019ve designed your Mobile Carousel, the next step is to automatically show it to a target audience.\nFirst, choose if the message should be\n\u2018Ongoing\u2019 or \u2018One-off\u2019\n:\nThen, choose who this carousel should be sent to:\nNew mobile app users\n\u2014 Anyone who downloads and uses your app for the first time\nafter\nyou set the carousel live.\nExisting mobile app users\n\u2014 Anyone who has already downloaded and used your app\nbefore\nyou set the carousel live.\nAll mobile app users\n\u2014 Anyone who has already downloaded and used your app, and anyone who does in future.\nNext, add rules to define the audience for your carousel. For example, to encourage free users who are getting value from your app to upgrade, you could target anyone on the \u2018Free\u2019 plan, who has been a user for more than 30 days, and had more than 10 sessions:\nNote:\nLocalisation is a feature that we are looking to build in the future, however, it is not currently not built into Carousels, meaning that you would need to create a separate Carousel for each language that you are looking to support.\nPro tip:\nThis example uses a combination of \u2018\nAnd\n\u2019 & \u2018\nOr\n\u2019 rules.\nLearn more about creating detailed audience filters here\n.\nSend your carousel programmatically\nIf you\nlaunch your carousel with code\ndirectly from within your mobile app, you can choose to turn off automatic sending:\nImportant:\nMobile Carousels sent automatically will only send to each matching user once.\nIf a user hasn\u2019t updated to the version of your app with Intercom\u2019s latest SDK they won\u2019t receive your carousel, but they will still be present in the audience list if they match the filters.\nAs a result, the audience size may differ from the actual number of users who receive the Carousel.\nA workaround for this is to use the\n\u2018Android/iOS App Version\u2019\naudience predicate, choosing only versions that have supported SDKs installed in them.\nIf a user matches the filters for more than one Mobile Carousel, we\u2019ll show the oldest one first, based on when the carousel was set live.\nTo ensure your carousels send as expected, you must initialize the mobile SDK when your app starts (Learn how to do this for\niOS\n&\nAndroid\n). This may lead to an increase in the number of active people you track in Intercom.\nAdd a goal\nTo accurately gauge the impact of a Mobile Carousel, you should define a goal based on your users\u2019 data that represents the action you want them to take in your product. Choose \u201c+ Add goal\u201d and select an attribute or event:\nWith the example used above - encouraging free users to upgrade their plan - a suitable goal might be \u2018Plan is pro\u2019.\nNext, select the period in which you\u2019d like your customers to achieve the goal.\nImportant\n: If app users complete the action after the period you define, this isn\u2019t counted towards the goal stats.\nSchedule your carousel\nNext, you should schedule a carousel to send at exactly the right time. There are three ways you can do this:\nSet specific dates and times for it to start and stop sending.\nSchedule it to send during or outside your office hours.\nSet a custom delivery time during which it will send.\nNote:\nTrigger times are based on your\nworkspace\u2019s timezone\n.\nTo define a custom time, click the start time, then hold \u2018shift\u2019 and click the end time.\nYour message will then send during the selected period.\nYou can also set delivery times across multiple days.\nTip:\nRead this article to find out more about message scheduling.\nAnd that\u2019s it.

When someone clicks on your message they\u2019ll go straight to the page you choose. This encourages them to focus their attention entirely on your call to action.\nMobile Push messages vs Push notifications\nMobile Push messages encourage customers to take action, rather than chat. So your customers can\u2019t reply to a Mobile Push.\nYou can also send\npush notifications\nto notify customers when you send them a chat or post message through the Messenger in your mobile app. This is useful for starting a conversation with customers or when you need more space to get your message across than a\nMobile Push\nmessage allows. To do this, follow our\nguide for creating and sending chats and posts\n.\nIt's possible to send\npush notifications\nfor multiple mobile apps from the same workspace using\nmulti-brand configurations\nfor both iOS and Android. However, this is not currently available for\nMobile Push\nmessages.\nTo send Mobile Push messages or push notifications you must have the latest Intercom Mobile SDK\ninstalled\nin your mobile app.\nCreate and send a Mobile Push message\nFirst, go to\nOutbound\nand click\nNew message\nin the top right corner:\nThen, choose\nMobile push\nas your content type.\nYou can also choose to start with a pre-made template by picking this\ncontent type\nfrom the left sidebar.\nFor this example we\u2019ll start from scratch, but the following steps also apply if you customize a template.\nChoose where to direct your customers\nYour push message can simply open your app's home screen, or direct users with a deep link.\nDeep links send your users to a specific page in your app when they open your push message. Like taking them directly to their shopping cart, for example. Studies have shown that using deep links can even improve user retention, when compared to links that open your app's homepage.\nRead more about setting up deep links in your\nAndroid\nor\niOS\napp.\nIn the \u2018Content\u2019 section, enter your iOS and Android deep link URIs.

Your customers likely receive dozens of push notifications a day, so remember to keep it short, snappy and to the point. You can also add emojis and images to make it really stand out.

For example, your message can display the number of tasks a user has completed.\nA/B testing your message\nTo ensure that your content is performing as well as it can be, you should A/B test your message. Intercom makes it easy to create and send two versions of a message to see which is the most effective.\nRead all about A/B testing here\n.\nChoose your audience\nFirst, decide if it should be sent with a dynamic or fixed audience.\nA fixed audience message will only send to people who match your audience filters right now.\nA message with a dynamic audience send to everyone who matches the audience filters now, and anyone who matches the filters in the future. If you\u2019d like your message to be ongoing for a certain period only, you can define a stop date (see \u201cSchedule your message\u201d below).\nThen, add rules to select the exact group of people you\u2019d like to receive your message. For example, if you\u2019d like to send a message to active users on your free plan, the rules might be: Users with \u201cPlan is Free\u201d and \u201cLast seen on iOS or Android less than 30 days ago\u201d.\nIf you notice users match the message rules, but don't show in the audience of the Mobile Push message, it would mean that Intercom doesn't have push tokens for those users \u2014more on setting up push notifications can be found in the following docs.\niOS\nAndroid\nSchedule your Mobile Push\nNext, you can schedule a Mobile Push message to send at exactly the right time.

The code snippet options provided for iOS are:\nSwift Package Manager\nCocoapods\nManual Installation\nThe code snippet options provided for Android are:\nGroovy\nKotlin\nThe \u201cEnable user traffic for messenger\u201d toggle is\nrequired\nfor mobile installation of the Messenger.\nThe code snippet options provided for React Native are:\nYarn\nNPM\nExpo\nThe next step will be to \"Initialize Intercom\" within the codebase of your mobile app. You can also manage your API keys in this step. The code snippet options for iOS are:\nSwift\nSwift UI\nObjectiveC\nThe code snippet options for Android are:\nKotlin\nJava\nThe choices for React Native are:\niOS\nAndroid\nThe\nCheck installation\nbutton at the end offers a success notification if the Messenger has been successfully found for your chosen installation, or it indicates whether something has gone wrong.\nSecuring your Messenger with JWTs\nWe have recently improved our Messenger security offering to use JSON web tokens instead of HMACs. This update replaces the previous\nIdentity Verification (IdV)\nmethod with features designed to protect user data.\nWith JWTs, you benefit from:\n\u2705\nData protection\n\u2014 Sign and protect both user ID and email, along with\nany\nother user attributes.\n\u2705\nShort-lived tokens\n\u2014 JWTs can be set to expire, reducing the risk of misuse for compromised tokens.\nTo secure your Messenger with JWTs, choose iOS or Android\nhere\nand follow the instructions.\nNote\n: for React Native, you must still use Identity Verification as JWT support has not yet been released here:\nSecuring your Messenger with Identity Verification [Deprecated]\nIdentity Verification on mobile, go to\nSettings > Installation > Install for mobile\nand choose the installation platform; iOS, Android or React Native.\nSimilar to the initial installation step, you will be asked to choose which platform you wish to install the React Native SDK with (iOS or Android).\nCode snippets and instructions are provided on how to generate a HMAC code (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) within your backend codebase and provide it to the Intercom Messenger. This HMAC code is used by Intercom to verify the authenticity of user interactions in the Messenger.\nAn additional code snippet is provided so you can include the HMAC when initializing Intercom within your mobile app. The code snippet options provided for iOS are:\nSwift\nSwift UI\nObjectiveC\nThe code snippet options provided for Android are:\nKotlin\nJava\nFor React Native, we provide an example code snippet for how you can use the HMAC code to initialize Intercom with identity verification.\nThe final step in the identity verification process is to enforce identity verification. Once this is done all requests from the Messenger which do not include the valid HMAC code will be rejected.\nWhen you enforce identity verification for either an iOS or Android app the second step is marked as completed.\n\u26a0\ufe0f Shut down your user sessions on user logout\nEnsure that you shutdown Intercom to clear your customers\u2019 conversations when they log out of your app.\nHere's how you do it in objective C\n- (void)logout { [Intercom logout]; }\nHere's how you do it in Java\nprivate void logout() {\nIntercom.client().logout();\n}\nYou should\nonly log out an identified user\n. Logging out an unidentified user will result in orphan records that cannot be merged in future.\n\u200b\nIntercom knows when your app is backgrounded and comes alive again, so you won't need to log your users in again.\nFor more information see our\niOS\nand\nAndroid\ndeveloper docs.\nOptional: Set up push notifications\nWithin this step you will again have the option of the installation platform; iOS or Android. You can configure push notifications from this section, but it will not guide you through the process. Instead our developer docs should be used for push notification setup:\niOS Instructions\nAndroid Instructions\nReact native is not offered as an option for mobile push notifications.\nThis optional step is marked as complete when push notifications have been detected as set up for either an iOS or an Android app.\nImportant\n: Xcode 14 is now required to build Intercom iOS SDK v13.0.0+\nIn Xcode 14, there are several warnings logged to the console when the SDK is installed. The warnings stem from Intercom's use of WKWebView. There is a bug in Xcode 14 that triggers these warnings, and it is not an issue that Intercom can fix.\nThey are just warnings and Intercom continues to function as normal when they are present.\nHere are the warning messages:\nWKWebView Error - View Article and you see this in the console: Error acquiring assertion: <Error Domain=RBSServiceErrorDomain Code=1 \"target is not running or doesn't have entitlement com.apple.runningboard.assertions.webkit\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=target is not running or doesn't have entitlement com.apple.runningboard.assertions.webkit}>\nThis method should not be called on the main thread as it may lead to UI unresponsiveness.\n[Sandbox] Could not enable Mach bootstrap, errno = 22.\nDeeply integrate your Help Center in your mobile app\nIncluding your Articles Help Center directly in your mobile app\n, gives you many flexible ways to present help content to your users. Whether you use Intercom\u2019s pre-built UI, or develop your own custom presentation, you can give your customers exactly the support they need.\nKeeping your users\u2019 conversations secure\nTo repeat, we strongly recommend enabling Messenger Security on your iOS and/or Android app. This helps ensure that conversations between you and your users are kept private, and that one user can't impersonate another.\nFor detailed instructions on how to set this up see\nour help centre doc\nor\nyour security settings\n.

What if customers really have 2-3 addresses and when they send an e-mail you want to identify them to quickly provide support?\nIt's something that Intercom should work on.\nIn my opinion, there should be a primary e-mail address and additional addresses.

How can I undo my last operation?

For this example, let's call the tag that needs to be removed \"Tag X\".\nFind the users that you want to keep tagged with \"Tag X\" , and tag them with a new tag, which we'll call \"Tag Y\". If there are more than a few users, it's easiest to do this with a\nCSV import\n.\nOnce you've tagged these users with \"Tag Y\" you can delete \"Tag X\", then rename \"Tag Y\" to \"Tag x\".\nYou could also get the entire list of contacts\nhere\nand then remove each contact from being\ntagged\n. The only additional information you'd need to make that work would be the tag_id which they can find by getting all\ntags\nand searching for that tag by name so you can get the id.\nAlternatively, if you use series, create a series where the entry rule is \"Tag is Tag X\" then add an action to remove the same tag. \ud83d\udc4d\nRead this and other questions here on\nIntercom Community\n.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip\nNeed more help?\nGet support from our\nCommunity Forum\nFind answers and get help from Intercom Support and Community Experts\nRelated Articles\nConvert leads to users with series\nSeries explained\nWhy do I have duplicate users?\nContent tagging in the Knowledge Hub\nSeries FAQs"},
