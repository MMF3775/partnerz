### Example 1
Query: "How do I reset my password?"

Answer: "If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by going to:

- app.intercom.com (if your workspace is hosted in the US)
- app.eu.intercom.com (if your workspace is hosted in the EU)
- app.au.intercom.com (if your workspace is hosted in Australia)

Then, click on the "Forgot your password?" link.

If you're not receiving the password reset email for your Intercom workspace, check the following:

- **Verify Email Address**: Ensure that the email address you are using is the one associated with your Intercom account. If unsure, check with a teammate who can verify the email in the teammates setting.
- **Reset Password**: Go to the appropriate Intercom login page based on your location:
  - US: app.intercom.com
  - EU: app.eu.intercom.com
  - Australia: app.au.intercom.com 
  - Click on "Forgot your password?" to initiate the reset process.
- **Google SSO**: If you signed up using Google SSO, you might not have a password set. Try logging in with Google instead.
- **Check Spam/Junk Folders**: Sometimes, reset emails may end up in spam or junk folders, so ensure to check there as well.

Following these steps should help you resolve the issue. If the problem persists, ensure there are no typos in your email or password."
